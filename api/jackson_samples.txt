I've put together a preliminary full ASC route and started running SRsim on it. Gonna post more details about the anticipated route and performance tomorrow, but in the meantime here's what the elevation and our velocity profiles look like in terms of football fields.
I'll be by in 30 minutes
Any luck balancing
You don't need to be hooked up then right? At least to bleed
Could probably do it with just one other if you have to, lifting the side to slide in
I'll be there later around 5

The post cure is going to be another fun issue to deal with
Do we have the gel coat spec sheet on hand btw?
 You're right, but I wanted to talk about that with them in person instead of trying to explain over email. Mainly just wanted to get them on the phone, so I just put in specs matching the Toray cure to avoid confusion and give them a sense of time per visit.
:wewlad:
ya like trying to get SJ1 up CotA with a marand
It doesn't seem to hurt us that badly. It'd be a pain under 15mph, but at 25mph there's like a 0.25mph difference, so not that huge of a loss
ya, that sounds right..about 80RPM?
What was the old transition? Like 1mph?
on the net drive
btw, all of the data and post processed figures are in \Team Folders\Electrical Team\Telemetry\SJ1\2017-10-01 Regen Testing
Looks like the higher rms kicks in a little after 10mph, but it's close. Jumps from ~50 to ~60-62.
I'll be sending this to our contacts at Delta around 2 to get the ball rolling. I've been to their facility before, but since nobody else has I wanted to lead in with a visit first before we show up with tools, equipment, and molds. Either way, I don't envision the layup happening over fall break. Possible within the month, but I think this could take more than 1 or 2 weeks to fully arrange. I'll call them tomorrow if I don't get a response today.
For reference, that's about twice the torque we were getting at CotA. Would have to double check that, but I remember it being around 25-30 Nm instead
it'll be enough for RPoM, we thinks
Looked at some of the data from the regen test. Not completely done, but it looks like we decelerated at ~0.8393 m/s^2 with regen. Removing friction's contribution to stopping, that leaves *~210N or 60Nm of regen torque.*
I'm mostly hanging out in the office today (usual spot) although I will dipping out since KSU's new team is visiting. I've made some changes to the design (sorry lol) so just stop by when you guys get here.
no

 what's the login info for the grafana platform?
You guys ready? Should be coming up in 40 minutes

Shitposting IRL with Michael Lin
Man you're taking shitposting to a whole new level
I wonder what those meetings are about. Like they don't have any influence in any real government, so do they just complain for an hour? Are there dues? Do people pay $25 to complain together?
you're gonna cause another riot
yeh
Should ask them what their Crr2 is. They'll be like "what? can't hear you over our 4000kW diesel motors"
Where is that btw?

But will it yield?
L A P M A S S
Just to clarify, the event happening at 6 is an info session for 2nd round recruits. Those of you going through recruitment now just need to be here at 6:30 for the general meeting.
so do you have any new members?
They're IRC tubes but I'm not sure if they're the right size. I Don't remember off the top of my head
 Get the ones max linked instead. I don't have time to to check right now, but they might not be correct for our rim size. Max's fit a wider range, so they should be a safer bet
 no boba-bolas needed, just was wondering since we keep hitting our storage limit on slack
Any reason you guys are passing the files around on slack?
cool
You turned the car off, right?
thx
Plugging in the cluster doesn't necessarily connect all of the andersons. Some of them are like ~1mm apart
 Could you guys devote some time to fixing the anderson umbilical on the array? Talking about the one that connects the E-stop
make sure to bring your laptops if you weren't planning on doing so
But he's the business guy we usually interface email with
Would have to dig up his office phone number
Marcello, I believe
Functionally, the array will be an additional zone
Where does he do it?
Cool, this might be a good motive for a joint outreach/business/testing event. Depends on what his timeline for wanting to visit looked like.
Lol, adding a wing to the F350. Does he have any leverage at nearby tracks?
How'd it go ?
:boba_bola::dagger_knife::face_with_head_bandage:
Was talking about this with Ryan. Probably won't be a problem. I think Ryan mentioned having some replication on the test pieces if those get done in time. Overall, I think with the way the layup was done that's as good as it's gonna get in terms of air bubbles
Checked out the bellypan sunday evening and these were some spots that I and others pointed out still need to be worked on. Otherwise, I think it's smooth enough, but I don't think these spots are smooth enough yet. All else seems fine, though.
Close enough, just hang there
If you can get to the invention studio I can find you
Where are you?
Room 2404
Oh ok, you here yet
I'm heading to the MRDC now
Not initially
Also
can you guys make it to the MRDC at 6 (near room 2404) for a group meeting now that the general meeting is cancelled?
Millennials sure love their guacamoles and fidget spinners
I mean you'll need like 4 boxes of 20 each or so. Alternatively you can cellophane wrap them. That's what we did with the K2's since we couldn't unweld the modules
\Team Folders\Electrical Team\Telemetry\Post-Test Reconstruction Tools
For reference we didn't get any solar power in testing, so I hope nothing happened in between then and the race. Likely plugs, but still something we haven't verified
You can't? What if you clamped them all together with 2 clamps?
I think if you just glue the joints together it should be fine
Have you guys checked that the driveteks are ok?
A little delayed, but drive testing in about 20-30 minutes for anyone about to head to shop
Characterization while waiting?
Fookn legends
It (and all of the tires ~wheel~ we'll need) are on the table with the posters.
It's cool, we're just starting up. I'm in a hangouts meeting right (at SCC) but we can start by seating the half-seated NR77 to the NGM wheel
  When will you guys be getting here?
Wax Off - Future
Also, good news. I found an NGM that's half-seated already and another that's fully seated, so we can make that swap pretty quickly.
Hence why we had to make a different rear suspension for the marand
Reminder that we're aiming to do some testing of the car later today (if not, tomorrow). Likely toward the afternoon after the electrical training sessions since setup and tire swaps will have to happen first beforehand
I think the tabs with individual gauges should have an overview chart first that plots all of them (min-max bolded on bounds). That's what I'd personally care about first before checking individual values. Looks pretty cool though
Yeah probably not
oh, nvm then
How long will you guys be at shop?
They preferred to do the full disposal themselves
They really didn't care
I'd recommend you just do that. Let Jason know we want to get rid of them. That's how we disposed of the K2's
You don't need to, you can hand them over to ehs as is
So whered we leave off with characterizing the samples?
What was the issue before? They weren't placing the order or they kept turning you away?
Kelsey said they were
 did the lithium ion batteries get ordered?
I mean apparently it's still unknown if it did or didnt
Ok,  said it happened
 did the cells get ordered?
no, am lower than dirt
Still on my way. Sorry for the wait...meetings
Heading over now, should be there in 15
Assuming a constant load?
I want to show you guys our panels, so if you can go I'll meet you there.  are you going?
Were you told you can't?
I'll be at shop. Hang out with Justin instead. You can brief Xushai on our discussion as well
of a heart attack, probably
But if we could actually negotiate a deal with Cookout for even steeper discounts on their trays I'd die

Just thinking about this now, but this should be avoidable with SR2's bearings. Since they're not tapered I don't think they need as much preload
No snapchat?
Sure, that works
Hang out by the satellite dishes
room #'s say 1?
1st floor, room 117. I can let you in if you're outside.
Yup, that sounds reasonable
MCA?
So the lower gets charged until the voltages are equal
The higher voltage battery will discharge into the other
cool I'll hold you to that, thx
Ok. Also, would testing in 3 weeks be too aggressive?
start and end are absolute?
That too, although none of those will likely be more than 2-4 lines a piece. I meant being able to essentially run my recontool as we're getting data in.
I need to work with you at some point on the server-to-sim aspect of this
How's work on the 4G rig going?
We can meet in my office at Weber (building next to Skiles, with the satellite dishes)
Let me know by ~5, then. Are you guys west or east?
How would 6 work for the two of you? I've tried contacting Tara, also, but no response, so I'm assuming it'll just be you two working with me.
  as mentioned in , there's an unofficial shop day today. Would either of you be able to make it today? I can show you guys our solar cells, build materials, and we can decide on a storage solution. If not, we could just meet on campus.
wonder where that thing is nowadays
wew lad
I'm protected by fair use laws, pls dont sue
:stuck_out_tongue: sorry, if you guys want to use these pictures that I stole from Ruchi's video
Ya, that's where I got it from
going from MDF -&gt; Primed -&gt; FG layup
I was going through some presentations I made for SpaceX last year and found this picture. Thought you guys might find it useful in describing the layup process
He's a GT alum and a hiring manager, so I do recommend talking to him if you want to work for GM
Oh shit, that's my old boss. Might go then
Is there a guy from GM there that looks like Red from that 70s show?
What time?
So scientific
How's ordering going?
Just saying they never gave us any kind of answer, so it might not be worth it to hold out for an answer
They never gave us an answer on price last time either, even at the end. Not like that'll change our decision to ship it back anyway
So if the ASC coordinators stay true to what they said at the race and pick this track, the track TM system would only need to reach about 0.5 miles across with pretty direct field of view
I think I found the race track being considered for ASC and it's pretty flat.  Raceway Park of the Midlands (tentative). The max grade is 2.9%, which even stella can handle from rest with a marand. Bigger challenge is the tight turns. Turning models (w/r rubbing) will have more of an influence on our performance than transient models like at CotA. Overall, should be boring with 4.5 minute laps at 31MPH, cruising at like 8 Nm per motor and ~700W of total power draw. The latitude losses will be significant (We'd see like 500W solar with their average seasonal weather, too). We could achieve 100 laps (~220 miles) in one day, which would be enough to blitz our way into ASC in one day (205 miles required), assuming good weather. SJ-1, however, actually wouldn't be able to qualify (just barely), even for a 2-day qual.

Some interesting stuff. Also found some blurry pics of the ASC route and the elevation profile of "the long climb" which is ~3000' in 20 miles. That's 2.8% average, but the middle is like 6% for 10 miles. With our weight breakdown we should be ok. Gonna have to find it on google earth. If anyone wants to try finding it, the route is b/w Omaha, NB and ends in Bend, OR. Might try piecing together the route here in a week or so.
I think screaming at a lightning storm like zuko would be more appropriate
that was like 20 minutes from where I lived
oh man, their location is in torrance
Ya, that's one of my pics but I haven't added them to the drive yet
1v1 ruchi in nuketown to get headshot'ed
I'd recommend you guys try to get them to agree to fix it in AUS unless you're really sure you know what the problem is
:+1:
That's fine, just need to present the lightest of the bunch. Was mainly worried we might have a consistent offset like the older headways
Re weighed them?
Did you guys weigh any of these cells yet?
Never tried doing that from Matlab, can probably figure it out though
Lol
Csv?
To avoid having to update a cab?
Porque
We can also run them while we wait for the order. I just wanted to get some statistical uncertainty for when we're analyzing the full set
Tested that is. 7?
That'd put us at how many total?
Could all be done realistically before the end of tomorrow?
Ya, they look in family. Doing all of them?
:+1:
hmm
Ya
Do they only go to 4.2?
Cool, that'll confirm if it's in family. Have we done any full discharges from topped off to cutoff?
It does come out lower, though.  that sounds like a good idea
Yes, and cross checked with that other page from batteryspace
Pretty sure they'd line up if shifted
Oh wait sorry, scale, more like 0.25
3V for example. Maybe closer to 0.4Ahr
Find equivalent points on the graph and compare
No they don't have the same capacity
Seems undercharged by 0.5 Ahr
See how it looks offset
Doesn't look like it
Did you fully charge these?
Sounds ok then
But the edges are good? Do you think it's worth it to cross check the edge dimensions between the plug and molds?
I guess you could double check by measuring out the length and width
How's the lateral alignment? Sort of looks off from this angle
Nice!
Cotton says "Suh"
Resume pt 2 b-school boogaloo happening up in the Culc 317 at noon. Sorry for the last minute notice, been stuck in an OHR waiting room for most of my morning.
Ya, there will be one for friday
Might want to consider move that battery time to a little earlier if you're aiming to charge also since there will be a lot of shunting and balancing
ha, sunnice bro
I also couldn't find anything on their temp limits
haha, ya, except it's probably not very robust
That's actually without sun (6.6A at 133.2V, so ~850W)
actually, more like this, so honestly not that bad
like this is what life would look like for us trying to ramp up them RPM'z
Not sure if we're meme'ing around, but SR2 could go 23MPH with SJ1's mechanical specs (factoring smaller array and lighter weight). Could go 28 with anticipated specs. But no accelerating or hills.
They also appear next flashlights and vapes a lot
I can't find a spec sheet, but the optimal config for max energy and voltage would be 36S11P which is an impressive ~7.3kWh at 133.2V nominal, but based on what I can find they can't discharge very well. Only report I found was 0.6A, so like 6.6A for a whole pack
lel
Also drop a :page_facing_up: if you plan to go so I can get a feel for the head count
The resume workshop dealio is going to be tomorrow (not today, I got my days mixed up yesterday). I've reserved Culc 342 from 3-5. The idea is to give you guys some general tips on resume writing, career fair pitches, and 1st round interviews in the beginning and then go over individuals' resumes/pitches if they want advice (assuming the group isn't too huge). Also going to focus on how you can frame and present your GTSR work to different companies. Should be pretty casual, so just show up when you can with a hard copy of your resume and names of the companies at the career fairs that you want to visit and some idea of what you might like to do.

Let me know if you can't go but could come on Friday. If there's good interest I can do another on Friday or even the following week. Career fairs are in 2 weeks, so there's plenty of time. If any other vets on the team want to come to offer advice, feel free.
roboi
Did you guys know these were here? These were the unused spare cells from the first order of 140 last summer that I mentioned earlier this month. I'm going to use these instead of the extras you guys found since I know with more certainty that these are from the same headway order. There are 8 in total in the "spare headways" box under the battery table.
Ya, just DM me if interested
Ryan, Jared, and I just did a full charge and discharge of that same cell that produced ~7A-hr instead of 10. The new test is Test #2, the previous test (~7Ahr) is Test #1. Compared to the headway model from their spec sheets, it looks like the cell matches well and is healthy. Any duds with significant issues should show higher/lower capacity, which the manzanitas should catch. This just confirms we don't have a performance deficit.  We think we're good to start moving on to pack construction to charge with the manzanitas protecting.
use the fire hydrants
some shittyfoodporn material right there
this isn't twitter michael
I'll be visiting my dog back in louisiana, sorry
I'll head over around 6, probably get there about 6:30. I'll see if I can set it up
I can still come though
Ya, someone who knows how to run it should go. Just trying to save time here since you can't do an HG2 cycle until we've done a headway cycle. Realistically it'd be one or the other tomorrow unless there's another rig.
I think just a new one should be fine. We have race data for the old ones. I'd be fine with working on that tonight, otherwise would we not be doing any SJ1 pack construction tomorrow?
Is that from yesterday or did we retest a new cell from full? I think we'd need to double check on that
Some pics of the info session for your records
ran the numbers, if you multiply our laps by our mass we got 3rd. ya
who will oppose
michael lin makes a claim for the title of michael
there's two michael L's ffs
too many of you
we have to resolve this shit
A cover in the SCC is probably the easiest thing. Might be worth it to measure the individual Voc's of each module and record. That'll tell us where local damage has been done. Otherwise I just suspect leaning, dropping shit, etc. If the ones near the middle front or canopy are the worst that'd support this idea.
So many posers on the line nowadays I swear
browse more memes probably
I own that meme format now that's my thing

Do you still have it on
I just realized that you still had your FSGP tag on in that picture
Monday as the last day?
pokemon go to the polls
nah, we've been dancing on their grave for a while now
So this NZ launch company, Rocket Lab, failed to make orbit two months ago in their first launch attempt. Turns out it was due to the Range's telemetry hardware failing; no fault of the rocket or rocket lab. The Range's telemetry didn't have forward error correction causing the telemetry to go dark and for the flight officials to activate the onboard explosives for flight termination. Really sad, the rocket and its ground hardware were perfectly good and they would've succeeded in their first attempt but didn't through no fault of their own. Sad!
Lifting bars?
Please I want to know the shenanigans
Not if it was new after graduation
What was that?
otherwise this is just fake news
need video
If you guys are continuing the search, let's make the "deadline" for deciding how many need to be ordered and where to buy them from by tomorrow night
?
Did you guys check which cells had labels on the Orion test bench, or did you only look for a box of cells?
Before you do that, can you send a picture of the electrical rack with all of the subteam stuff on it?
Did you check all of the totes?
List off the main areas?
If they don't assume they're no good (could be very old, near dead cells). Did you check the shelves in the electrical closet?
Make sure they have labels on them from a label maker
But OK, I'll think of a way. Maybe we can have a meeting later this week
Ya, airhose will fix that
I think it'd be good to have a meeting about this. There's definitely a way to make both work.
I've seen what the space looks like with both in it. In the alternative, you'd be sanding the gel coat right next to the test bench, right?
Pretty sure there's a way to share the tent space and not move the car in the trailer while maintaining that efficiency
Ya, how often are you going to be literally parallel processing at the exact same time?
Or cover the belly pan with a tarp while you sand the array. How often do you want to be dividing work at the exact same time? Takes an airhose to clear out the sawdust
You talking about doing two motors?
For integrating BMS master a tabletop work station might be preferable (just for installation), but in general I dont see trailer storage as a good long term answer. SJ1 should stay in peak racing condition until SR2 is donezo and ready for electronics
I'm not a fan of putting SJ1 in a trailer and moving her electronics test bench, given that the whole point of last year was to make SJ1 the test bench. If the only issue is space I think there are ways around it. Given that we have 2x the space of any SCC team Id think there's a way to make both fit. For example: build separate array mounts (ie. Sawhorses) that let the array hover over the car.
It also has facts for SR2 which might be a little less commonly known than SJ1 since they're technically in flux until it's built
Just wanted to say to make sure you cross check with the quick facts document if you're not sure (e.g. weight is actually ~700lbs for the car but ~880 with driver)
You can also mention the big items in the immediate future, like layup, pack construction, array construction, etc. They'll end up having a part in that. When people ask for specs are you guys drawing from a common source?
How have those been going in terms of answering questions?
Because our car was allowed to race on an F1 track and was deemed safe enough by the officials to be displayed publicly, and that requires more info than the fire Marshall will even want. It really doesn't make any sense that we suddenly have to jump through new hoops. If we call him instead of emailing maybe this can go faster.
Does this guy have a phone number?
If you guys did take the car, who would drive the trailer?
What kind of testing would that involve?
Ya, how much harder is that to dev? Would two separate ones that you can switch between (if you want) be easier?
I meant the dev process more than operation (i.e. making it agnostic takes longer). So would it be two independent systems with a switch, or one platform that tries to do both?
I guess other than possibly money for the data
Why is that better exactly?
Like thinking about the scenario in FSGP where you'd lose 3G but somehow still have RF...that's potentially a very narrow window (~20 sec at cota) where you'd want that capability. If it's easy and one extra step beyond MVP, sure, just wondering if it'd be worth the effort
More like would having the redundancy make it more complicated
Ya, you mentioned you'd use the RF for ASC. Why the combo on the track?
How is using an RF/hotspot hybrid more robust than just using the hotspot?
Google "spinner"
I'm still a fan of transmitting cut out data in dumps when connection is regained. Might help make the RF cut out less bad. You're talking about intermittent cut outs right?
Would highly recommend it to be robust against any track. CotA is definitely one of the worst for direct transmissions, though
As a side note, our set up would work well for a road race (mock races are similar to ASC). But then again for a road race you don't need to modulate speed as strategically as you do in a track race
The data logger also didn't log some times but got most of the runs. We think it's because it was removed a couple of time without the car power cycling
Ya
It served a valuable purpose. As expected, a continuous connection around the track wasn't possible. We didn't place an antenna on the roof, so only about 20 seconds of data would come in during hot laps. It's main function was to check the SoC as it passed and verify that it matched my simulations. We raced the first day without it, but for the 2nd and 3rd days it was used. Even in the limited capacity it was pretty useful. On the first day we'd have to wait for the SD card during pit stops to do data to sim comparison, which we still did, but the SoC check every lap helped with being able to stay on the track as long as possible. Luckily the sims and data matched pretty well so we didn't need to do SD card checks very often. A data dump every lap wouldve still been nice, though. One team recommended using 3G to transmit TM to a server at their school that they could access remotely and they had almost no connection issues, so a pretty good idea.
Neat
How independent can that platform be?
There's potential for a sanding equivalent of a "no XP waste" joke here somewhere, but I'm too lazy to put it together
At previous FASETs there have been spots, usually at a corner of tech green. Also I'd think trailering would be fine even with our tires unless the summer crew wants to try changing them (pain in the ass of you don't know how)
Car being in grass shouldn't be a problem unless it's like weeds or something. Who told you it'd be in grass though?
Should be. You can either reach from the driver compartment or through the rear (do last if you have to).
With long arms maybe. You can also remove the rear fairings to avoid removing the array
Lower priority, but would be nice to know root cause
Any discussion about the suspected poly fuse?
Could you get a pic of the michelins?
Lol, ya
could someone take a picture of our tire treads on the front and rear? If possible, a pic of our spares treads too? Trying to get a before/after of what &gt;300 miles will do to them
also  we have a poster of an SR2 rendering hanging up in the shop. You talking about that?
Definitely wouldn't just keep upstairs though
Pretty sure they would work if charged. They're just not very powerful
Do you want to specifically allocate space for parts we could sell or dispose of in a more "environmentally conscious" way?
But it got the Steve Stamp of Approval
or nussey sold it all on craigslist
or on fire
if I check the SCC cam I wonder if everything will be gone
hmm, no word since
I can probably answer texts, but no calls. Would recommend only asking me if nobody else is quite sure what something is
The battery box is Kevlar with divinycell core
Fair enough. Maybe making the work spaces usable again at a bare minimum?
Whats the goal for this session?
justin: lol, definitely didn't produce more than 1000W. When did you read 1400 W/m^2
justin: bro it's 1000W
Careful, don't get too comfortable. You have a lot less than 360 days if you want it to work reliably. Gotta fix known problems as early as possible to save time for the problems you don't even know about yet.

I'd still recommend moving the board to another location that's more than just a few inches away from the main bus lines. I suspect the board itself is what's being affected. Going from its current location to ~3' away should theoretically drop interference by orders of magnitude.
Other than the bugs we ran into in the first hour, Stella has not broken down once. Tons of other cars have. So our focus on reliability this year is paying off
21 laps net, 54 total. I think we're 6th or 7th. Weather was pretty torrential this evening. If tomorrow morning is clear we should have a full pack of pure solar energy. If Jason, Michael, and I can each pull off ~2.7 hour drives without pit stopping, it's possible to hit :100: laps with each of us doing 16 laps. Jason did 17 today in one sitting using 20% of the pack, so it's totally possible with a full pack and faster speed. If you're interested I can post an overview with data and stuff
So far we're ~7th~ 6th out of 18 teams (12 that have passed tech inspection). Jason just got done with his first set of laps and Michael is going in for his second. Should be able to squeeze in one more racing segment before we go to the charging bay
If ALL goes well, definitely over :100: by the end, but we'll see how the day goes
Finishing our first hour, gonna have 8 laps total and 3 net. Almost on point with prediction. If all goes well, ~40 laps by the end of the day
Here's the speed circuit we're running
we got positive laps muthafuckas!
Ya, no point in stopping it now.
For the following fiscal year I mean. Just keep a note, what we spend could be used to drive a bill.
So just to recap: going with Michael's reservation regardless of funding source, correct?  have you looked at our travel allocation in the budget?
Are you copying them on the emails to Jason about the F350 status
Ya, I was actually there when we did it in 2014 and it's not a good idea. We only did it because the F350 broke down half way to Austin. I'd recommend shelling out for an option that has safety and security for getting to CotA in one piece and in top shape. We've been aggressively preparing for this all year and have been ready for this race for months now so it'd be a real shame if we showed up under equipped to what should be our most successful FSGP.
So we can't reserve it right ? Also, are the agency and foundation accounts drained or inaccessible?
Magnesium fidget spinners
And how's that supposed to buy anything  ?
Chances are other options won't be significantly better. Where would the funds come from?
Drivers
Regardless of cost there should be 2
Or just reserve?
Are you calling them to make a payment?
So no reservation?
The list with cars in race ops says lilys car and the F350
Not enough tires
Maybe, could call them
Pretty sure it's fleet vehicles only
Should be static
Enterprise will rent pickups for $350 a week
Anyone going to shop that could throw the data from the SD card on the drive?
Figure out why it's so shit
Should put a data logger on the 350
I would think no since today was spent testing. Might be more valuable to do it tomorrow since we can talk about the test &amp; results.
How is testing going?
Sounds good
Get enough to sustain someone for 1-1.5 hours in 110F
New phone who dis?
Wrong chat?
Ya Im being replaced
Also Elon's son is interning with our group now, so that's neat
Front and center boi
Launch in 3 minutes if anyone is interested btw. Gonna be a droneship landing with a reflown booster that never left the cape for full refurb
ryan.babaie: When you guys do drive try to keep it as continuous as possible except for 10 minutes pit stops every 1-1.5 hours (ie. don't do 3 hours in the morning, break for lunch, and come back) like the race. Also for thermal reasons to see if we're on margin for anything here that would get us in TX
Cool, thanks for the confirmation! Is it hilly from your house to there or on the loop? Google was showing +/- 1% grade on the path to the loop but up to ~5% on the loop at certain parts. Does that sound sort of right?
OK

5 minutes for me
I can tune in for tomorrow
Can't make it to this either
Too much traffic? Any risk of that being a deeper problem?
Did you guys record the data from the draining?
Here in my garage
Should put a giant GT rug over it
That looks so bad
Forgot to send this yesterday, but if you guys need for future FASETs this contains brief info and specs of the vehicles and team history
Yeah, I don't think that's very likely
No, in Russia. Also, the risk of roll-off isnt a thing I'd say. The tethers are more for preventing the array from flying off which is more likely to happen front-back. The quarter turns are for shifting. To move tethers all you need is a hole which the front ribs have
russian one
also there was a launch at 2:20 here
since it's metal
front one? I just meant move the rear array tether away from the inductors
dont u question my life decisions
also consider moving the array tether to the other rib
but it probably will
unless you measure it and it doesn't
Also yall should put the anti-oxidant paste on those connections between the washers if you haven't. Will help to remove gaps and reduce resistance a little further.
Didn't we decide not to run the motor free-spinning?
or program that torque to go to the motor instead
Would definitely recommend fastening those wires down though. Something to kill any torque on the board caused by tension
Nice!
Noice, I'll look at dat data when I get home tonight
Also there's a GTSR quick facts page somewhere on the drive. I can try to find it if you guys would like to have it
Has the data from this past weekend been out on the drive yet?
If they could figure out how to operate their machine
am intern , lower than dirt
I'll add it when they make his wikipedia page
Dude who sits a few cubes down from me just became an astronaut. Pretty cool. His name is Robb Kulin for any interested
And a cone for safety
Live by the green route you die by the green route
jared: S1 landings on land happen when there's enough fuel to do it because it has to do a boostback burn to get itself back to the pad. If the payload is too heavy or the orbit is too high, they land on ship that'll just hangout where the rocket would naturally fall, so no boostback burn. The one 2 weeks ago had no landing because it was a heavy payload to GTO, so no room for legs or landing fuel.
Also if the space you'd want (to avoid shade) is usually filled, you might want to put cones out tonight. Not sure how dead the SCC is
Any prep issues?

Don't have any good ones with me
Would it be possible for someone to send me a picture of the composites tent (the vehicle plug and mold, not the tent itself), frame, and suspension parts?
Also I've confirmed the people sitting next to me are part of the Boring Company.  They're literally browsing boring machines on eBay
One somewhere on the front half of the array, middle, and rear would be good I think. If not, use a thermistor for consistent logging and just temp gun it every 15-30 minutes from different regions
 is there only going to be one thermistor or will you have multiple around the array
Do you want to make a functional schematic or something of the setup in case we use it again at the race?
Ya ok, never mind. So we'll have the mpp values, irradiance, and final energy to the batteries along with array temp and cloud cover footage &amp; times to back up with NOAA. That'll do it
I was just thinking the output would be the optimized current and the input would be the raw solar current. Do you know where the manual is? Is it the 10 page one?
oh, I_in is (Impp)?  Wouldn't I_out be Impp?
No explicit Iout?
Got a ~light~ link?
 Were you or Hayden ballasted when driving?
So one of the figure 8's is hayden and another is you?
Who else drove?
Surgical dremel'ing.  That's good then, hopefully no need to add clearance stiffeners.  Ryan mentioned a loose caliper when he called me. Did you guys figure out why?
Oh so you already shaved off a bit of the PVC?
Was there any fairing contact?
Ya, as you said in a real scenario you'd be able to release to roll the wheels again and recontact. But the fact that the data includes skidding means it can be scaled out without being too unrealistic
that's actually really good
Ok, but wheel locking and skidding happened?
aight
  Did you guys need to adjust the brake bias at all?
Galaxy expansion: sleep _with_ the car
More expansion: sleep in the car
Expanding brain: camp out in the MRDC parking lot so you can't oversleep
Were you able to find any other material?
Given that the NCR's are moped/motorcycle tires and they fit the rim profile, I'd like to think the Michelins which are also for the same vehicles would follow whatever the norm is. The 80/90-14 geo also pretty much sets that they'll fit over the wheel.  Should probably come to a decision of buying NCR's or Michelins in the next few days so they'll be here for the pre-race road test.
 Did the UK company say what the shipping time would be? Hopefully not more than a week if they've got them in stock.
also well shit
woah the thread feature neat. It didn't pop up on mobile for some reason
Im pretty sure it'll fit any way, but maybe he could check
What if you sent him info on our rim profile to have him check?
So regarding the wet brake test, that'll require having some continually wet pavement for the car to brake on at 31MPH. The SCC parking lot isn't big enough to get to 31, so we'll need some ideas for spots on campus (MRDC is already in the running of course).  One that might work would be to find a place on campus where we could hook up a hose and plan around that. Would need a hose, though.  Alternate idea that's even more jank is to bring buckets, fill them up in the MRDC bathrooms, and dump them on the pavement. Basically one person just doing bucket-filling full time during the test.
Also also, has anyone looked into whether or not you guys can do the wet brake test at the MRDC? Like ideally you'd hook up a hose to keep the pavement as wet as possible like dynamics.  Considering all of the improvements we've been making to the car have been to make it go faster and reduce brake interference I'd say that the wet brake test is the one we're the most likely to fail. As a point of reference, we have to be able to brake at 0.5g's on wet pavement and we can barely do that on dry pavement.
Also I'm pretty sure stiffeners are on the scrap "tree" thing near the door
How likely is it that the brake rub issue will be worked on before mock dynamics?
Most of the people in the  channel are. It's a public channel so you can see who's in it
I doubt you'll get a response unless it's someone's personal email or you try calling them to find a person to talk to. We're sort of a niche market :/
Get back to work
Glad they're finally being used for something
I'll still be at work when the meeting happens, so I just want to recommend only keeping essentials in each column and moving non-critical things to the icebox. That's just so you can look at a major testing goal and know, at a glance, what are the big items that need to be done.
 what are you thinking of for a new load?  At noon you'll be getting like 8A
But if the array was hot and it was close to sunset having 110W per array is pretty reasonable
Slight sigh of relief there
AA's on the temp gun right?  That's pretty great that the DT's worked tho
How hot did it get?
Ok so nothing logged yet?
Oh man, how'd that happen?  Got any data from it or just those initial numbers
How's testing going?
I've got a thing I have to go to at 7 ET, so if you guys want to have the meeting earlier, maybe 6 ET, I'd be game
or you just combine the parts of each scenario you like
good ole aerospace
Saw a requirement today that specified that, of three design scenarios, we had to be compliant "with more than one but less than three"
That'd be good
 do you have a screen shot or some visual showing the current layout of info on the dash screen?
The neoprene probably doesn't need to compress a ton to be air tight enough for the requirement. Rubber gasket could work too. Any material that even slightly seals it will probably do fine
 Is that possible to get on the data logger? The torque decrease happened during parking lot tests, so it should be possible to recreate it
 that was during a break in orientation. Also, there's a launch today at 7:20 Eastern...good timing for first day
No, it has DSP temp on the WS22, but I also tried estimating the q_dot from phase line resistance and it wasn't that large
From what I can tell there's no distinct change between tests and no significant relation
Who asked about the influence of C-phase temperature on torque reduction?
oxford program peeps
if someone gets me the kmz's for ATL to LA we can figure out how long it'd take the car
strap a chainsaw motor to that bike
fricking physics majors and their units
8 days to bike...nonstop
8
yup
I actually looked at how long it would take to walk to LA from ATL....31 days
if youd flown delta youd be here by now
im already here man
that's what you get for walking all of the way to california, brian
where the link at
Sometime later tonight when get I back from baton rouge I'm gonna try to put out a performance summary dealio along with necessary info for doing mock-dynamics. A good target to try running that would be the last week of May, both to detect any race-ruining bugs early and because Hayden might be able to come to oversee people actually driving the trailer in tight scenarios as well as offer advice for slalom and figure 8
Yup, I'd agree that just the wires would need to be shielded
 Is that for shielding the car from the MPPT or the internal wires from each other?  Externally I think most of the noise from the MPPTs is going to be in the wires from the RLC circuit switching sending ripples down the line.
I think it's like 1" T H I C C uncompressed, maybe 0.125-0.25" compressed
Does McMaster specify ferritic vs austenitic stainless steel (wouldn't want to mix those up)?  I think for this application Velcro would probably tight enough since the air is just going to run parallel to it.  Probably simple enough to test before buying ferritic steel
For the battery box, though, we've usually just attached the vent to the rib which isn't great considering so much air leaks from the space caused by the battery box cradle. Having one of those pieces be able to attach and detach from the box when we impound the batteries would be a good idea. I think we might've talked about the use of magnets or maybe velcro
I would agree with something like that, specifically the circular flanged piece which your CAD seems to reflect. You can just epoxy the vent tube to the inside of that piece
Also on the side where the battery exhaust feeds in, are you making an attachment for the vent tube to bolt on there?
So you could have a similar lid to the last one, except on the inside of the flange have neoprene
You could probably use the neoprene foam as gasket material
 I saw you updated some stuff on the MPPT enclosure lid in the network drive just now. I emailed Steve before I left just to double check that the current design idea is good and the only stipulation he added was to make sure it was as air tight as possible. "Air tight" would mean no easily detectable flow of air, so if you stuck your hand by the lid you shouldn't feel or hear any air leaking out.  This might make a hinged design obsolete unless we put tape over the hinge gap or something.
Maybe another hour
Hayden and I are in the office rn btw
Like in the next few minutes?
The matte black and gold lettering is classy as fuck
You still at MRDC?
Where u at boi?
Go down the stairs in front of the invention studio and go to the right
 is anyone here able to go pick up the MPPTs from the MRDC?
Never mind, just removed the the spring attachment to the lever so it retracts underneath the array without engaging the brake
 I'm gonna have to remove the plate unfortunately so we can put the array on for testing
How's the range of motion?
For the record, they were out of balance the same way the whole time I was charging them.  The graph's shape didn't change.  If it was a bad cell it would grow and deplete at different rates which I'm not seeing.
I'm not concerned about the string being higher as a whole, I'm more concerned about how it "internally" got so unbalanced
On the curved portions of the SoC, yes
Resting
Also, I mentioned the ~26 A-hr absolute because right now the BMS internally thinks we're at 46, so that plot was Coulomb counting just this session
Charged the pack up by about 25 A-hr. Given that the rest of the pack was on the low-side, an absolute SoC of ~26 A-hr is reasonable. From the voltage distribution it looks like 1-8 are not only the most out of balance with the rest of the pack but that set is also out of balance within itself, which is interesting. Any knowledge of sparking that may have happened on that set?
I ran into a SpaceX dude at the airport today who is a CS guy reworking their HR database using a program he made using SQL. He said they heavily use SQL, C#, and Python, so if you guys get a chance to interview with them you should make sure to reserve a bullet on your resume for the SQLite used in the telemetry dashboard
I was going through some of my old photos from when I lived in Detroit for the summer and wanted to share this. Front page of the local news. Things were so much more wholesome back then.
I see potential for an "expanding brain" meme here. Take a unit like 1F and morph it into a mix of english and SI base units
If it can be done earlier then I'd say go for it, but that sounds good at least
Is someone replacing the fairing covering?
aight thx
woah done already
If it'd be possible to mask the throttle values corresponding to regen as negative that'd be useful too since solar will also register as negative current
Just in data logging and TM
Is it possible to have regen throttle registered as negative?
Just pulled some of these graphs from one of the loops we ran. You can see regen working when the current goes below zero (no solar during this test), but the throttle stays within [0,1]
or are they both positive?
It'd probably be fine if it's the same.  &lt;0 would just mean regen, right?
Are you saying it doesn't distinguish the driver's command vs. the command the WS acts upon?
During the test I could see when he was flooring it and it often matched with the max torque being applied
Ya
Yea
throttle and target RPM
I should be able to come
It's located in the drive under Race Ops -&gt; Mock Races
hit me up with a couple kg's of that :arrow_up::arrow_right: my dude
Ryan or Lindsey
Nein. Groups will be made so people are sanding together as often as possible with someone from aero there to demonstrate what to do. Blocks of time where you're free during the week will be fine (e.g. I'm free all day Wednesday and after 5 on Thursday).
In the last run on Loop 2, we managed to get the car from near 0 to 40 MPH. I didn't start the log until we were at ~12.5 MPH, but we actually accelerated faster than I'd predicted, hitting 35 MPH in ~0.2 miles. That's ridiculously close to being feasible for CoTA....so ya, pretty good shit - this kind of info is exactly what we needed.

In a few days we should be able to pinpoint with a ton of confidence what we need to do to conquer the hill at turn one.  So thank you to everyone who was a part of conducting this test.  Things are starting to shape up for a really successful FSGP 2017.
Data from the mock race is on the network drive.  Tomorrow and Wednesday data analysis should be done with another recap summary (like from the first mock race) of how the car performed.  However, I do have some initial data that's pretty exciting.
We'll arrive in 15 minutes
Ok cool, we'll just need at least one for the chase car to keep TM and route simulations available
Ok, sure go for it. Trailer is going to take longer to get there anyway so it'll probably even out
err, magnets
You don't have stickers?
and do chase and lead have their magnets?
Did anyone pack the power inverters for the cars?
Driving directions to location
Google my maps of the routes
This will be the channel we use to coordinate logistics for the mock race tomorrow. In this channel I'll post the test document plan as well as relevant route maps, testing plans, etc. in the next hour or so.First of a few announcements is a reminder to *be at the shop at 6am*.  We'll be loading the car into the trailer, triple checking packing, and then debriefing the test plan. The plan is to leave with wheels rolling at 7 am. We'll be driving to Sunset Village near Macon where the roads are very flat and should arrive around 8:30-9. Once there, we'll unload the car and begin the tests in caravan with initial testing lasting from 9-11, followed by solar charging and data analysis from 11-1, and then additional testing from 1-3. At 3, we'll load up and head back to shop hoping to arrive by ~4:30.More details will follow as the test document is assembled. Just be sure to set your alarms and get here on time!
man fuck yelp
she's a vegan
Also rotten tomato. Score has been getting low.
Big announcement folks. We just got rated 5/5 stars on FB. Make sure to hit us up and rate us on Yelp and Uber, too.
I'll be working on mock race planning today around 4:30 probably in the Culc if anyone would like to join me to help out or learn about how the last one was planned, feel free to drop by and find me. Having Google Earth would be a plus.
 Will we be able to purchase tomorrow? Is SOFO's credit card issue resolved?
Thought you guys used wash boards and clothes lines over there
Sun doesn't shine at woodies
Won't work
While you were busy partying, I was studying *The Blade*
take that, recursion
Could we solve this problem by filming jason getting the footage in a room where all the walls are mirrors?
Yup, that's the SCC waterjet. Pretty sure Jason could get the footage of the footage being made
Almost forgot about this one. Made it on June 2nd, 2015. A legit solar meme
ka'ching
not even their final form
don't pretend like you don't already know the answer to that
I see your shitty multimeter meme justin

There's also going to be a similar deal going on tomorrow, same'ish time.  If you can't make it tonight, tomorrow would be good too as a "substitute" for Saturday since a lot of people will be gone.
lookinGood.exe
what like add in the brian kuo pic as one of the running programs?
ya, me too thanks haha
Cool, thanks for the feedback
is the edge icon a solid choice though?
figured I'd give it a beta test before going to meirl
what do you guys think of this custom meme, hot off the presses?
You guys might want to open the garage door if you want to keep the tent fans on, otherwise they're not really doing anything super useful ventilation-wise
Ah, I see. I'll be there later (senior design T/R this semester). Saw the commit included setting Regen to 100% so I thought maybe you were adding the response saturation
 Did your push include saturating the rate of the regen commands?
That's what you get for having a complicated name like Brian
Yup
Boost converters are mounted in the car now
7/10 good effort tho
Watt in solar irradiation*
Both of the modems came in?
 what's going on here?
33"x19.5"
have a seat
felt a disturbance in the force
no michael don't
 When using those readers are you taking your card out of your wallet?  Might be the card reader.
Oh god pls it looks so bad
Ya imma go to sofo tomorrow and get it ordered
Would you need 2?
Well, the big thing is possibly no need to be reimbursed, so we could get 2
so I imagine a few days
they offer expedited shipping
what about this source
but ya, I'll see about getting a replacement
and the emails
ill delete them
oh shit
lol it wasn't me I promise
Ready*
We're read to the conference room
Ya I'm on my way now
Did you just test the one?
Sure, we can do that. I'll probably be 15 minutes late, then.  will you be able to get there on time?
We'll meet in the MRDC next to or inside of the usual gen body meeting room (2407) depending on if it's taken. unless anyone else has location suggestions.
Some of them aren't valid, such as him suggesting we put a diagonal truss member across the entrance/exit to the battery compartment which would prevent us from removing the batteries.  Some of them were him suggesting removing gussets. Looked at both of them?
Portion of Dick Roberto's comments about the frame.  These are his suggestions of structural modifications to make.  I recommend that we either make them now in the next few weeks, or never make them at all (i.e. don't plan on changing the frame after the car is built...)
Unfortunately 128V is as high as a max-energy headway pack can go (smaller 18650 Li-ions that we're looking at won't have this problem), but it's good to know. Wanted to make sure you guys knew.
At the conference, we had a 1-on-1 with one of the inspectors and, after seeing the mock race analysis report, recommended that the pack voltage might be factoring into the torque output.  In previous acceleration tests 55 N-m appeared to be the maximum the motor would output, and this was later verified during the Mock Race when the car's performance matched models assuming this torque. After working to factor the voltage back into the models, it looks like for our nominal voltage (128V) roughly ~59 N-m is what we should expect to see.
 do you have the response link for the whenisgood?  Would be useful for knowing when to schedule times for repairs in the next two weeks
Is that one broken now?
For SR2, mounting on the main vertical member of the rear half of the roll cage (same spot we'd been assuming) should have enough clearance between it and the canopy to fit that.  For SJ1 there might be clearance in essentially the same space, but not sure.
Oh ya, I think I met that guy who actually bought them at the conference
(small separate discussion) Did you guys already verify that your LG vendor can provide the lot # of the cells?
Getting mass too
12 right?
Overall, though, it was decently productive. Didn't really get a solid number on what our max range capability is. Mainly verified that a decent connection can be held at 1000 ft. away even with trees and other outside objects in the way. Also found that radiation from the PTT radio might be causing interference with both the TM and other parts of the car depending on the frequency. Doing a catch-up dump any time comms are lost then regained will be useful, whether it involves the transmitter detecting a loss or the receiver requesting a data dump from the time of the lost connection to present time. Some other issues with the motor in early PWM were found, too. Regen. also works decently.
Testing plan is located here so you can see what we were hoping to do:
that's not bad
MRDC bridge balcony thing?

 realistically (pessimistically) how quickly do you think those sheets can be cut?
oh right I forgot
Can't tell what's dirtier: burning coal or these memes
woah the conference kind of brought it to life
On average, the pack went from mid-60s F to lower-mid 80s F drawing about 10-15A on average for about 2 hours
If you want to know what the temperature will likely be based on past measurements, you can reference the BMS recorded temperature of each module over the course of the mock race found here: Team Folders\Electrical Team\Telemetry\SJ1\Arduino Logs\drive test logs\Mock Race 1-14-17\Mock Race 1-14-17\Raw_Plots
Yup, q = integral(R_equivalent * I(t)^2 dt)
^work done on determining if a non-power-optimized wide range Buck-Boost conversion could work as a temporary MPPT substitute
Isn't the IEEE that fake news tech website?  Don't believe the media so easily, Justin.  SAD!
Ok then, so really we just need to make a connection for it on the 12V line from the MeanWell converter on the Pb-Acid test bench
It receives power from the voltage sense connections to the modules, right?
SJ1's area-drag coefficient (C_D_A) is 0.13m^2.  SR2's, via CFD, should be around 0.1m^2
6 weeks from now maybe, so around the end of February.  They're 6-8 weeks of lead time right?
are you happy with the conversation you've started  ?
about 5
that was actually a commissioned piece by Bharat
oh wow you found it
I guess this means you guys haven't discovered the very first memes folder hidden away in the archives of the previous drive, untouched since the great drive fire of January 2016
holy shit
^ Sunday is just for this week because we didn't want the mock race to interfere with the shop day (and give us MLK day to re-test anything that fails). Aside from this week, the new leadership voted for Saturday to be the communal shop day.
 Sorry for not responding to your DM.  I'd actually email Melinda Wilson or, if she doesn't answer, Carry Ogletree.  Ms. Wilson is listed in the ME school as "posters &amp; banners".
If you guys would like to talk about the route over hangouts, I'm free until about 5 ET to do so, otherwise this route seems solid enough to me for a driving inspection.
 How would you advise going around Conyers then?  We'd aim to start at 10 a.m. and that route would be about a 2 hour drive (as shown by the graphs)
When the route is finalized we can.  Google Earth gives very good hill grade estimates, so I wanted to go through the proposed routes and record all hill grades at every intersection, make sure it isn't too steep, and reroute if necessary.  Then once that problem is out of the way we can save road quality checks and recording speed limits for an inspection drive.
For a general overview, I'd agree. These routes can be modified (I just gave it a first pass when making them), so we could route around city centers. One issue with Six Flags is we have a pretty steep hill to deal with early on that would require at least a 30 MPH runup. We can narrow it down to these three for now, but stuff like intersections on steep hills or low speed limits in hilly areas where we'll need a lot of momentum will be the next thing to look at.
Looks like the latter.  Saw some announcements from September saying that google maps might be able to do it.  Looks like we'll have to try looking up roads or highways, streetview, and educated guessing if neither of those work.
Just as an FYI, the KML/KMZ files in the folder can be uploaded to Google Earth to see the route, including the elevation/grade. We should be able to glean everything but road quality and pot holes from that.
Ya, as long as we can narrow down a final route by the 28th that we check out later, that'd be fine.
I was hoping we could have a prep-discussion sometime before New Years, but I don't think anyone would have time to do road inspection beforehand with Christmas.  Since we're considering a few different routes, inspecting the "top candidate" by the end of break probably be good.
In the pdf I set the weekend of the 14th to be a good date as we apparently have a 3 day weekend then.  As for the time, having us driving around noon would be fine for potentially more solar power if we're able to work out a fix, but earlier in the morning is probably better on the weekend to avoid traffic.

I've mapped out and simulated several routes in that folder.  Some of them are near/in Atlanta for convenience, but the best candidates are going to the be ones outside of Atlanta, named "Southern GA" and "Lithonia".  Could you guys organize among yourselves and the race ops group to look at the following items:

.) If our desired speeds are in violation of local speed limits, over or under
.) How busy are the roads we’re travelling on (Google Earth)?
.) If the car has to come to a complete stop (intersection), will we be able to static start the motor (i.e. do  we have to stop on hill greater than 5% grade)
.) Are there good parking areas nearby that we’d need to get permission for?
E.g. one route has us in a church parking lot.  Would they be cool with us using it on Saturday?

We may also want to take some time to investigate the route beforehand, especially for more rural areas, to determine if it will be safe for us to drive.  It'd be good if we could get some opinions on these routes ready by around the 28th.
I've started compiling information about the mock race in the following folder.  Before trying to design a route, make sure to read over the Mock Race Readiness pdf. The routes need to comply with a &lt;50 mile maximum range just for insurance so that, if we have to, we can last off of no solar power.  If you make a route, try to do it in Google Earth and save as KMZ or KML, that way I can extract the geographic data and run it through my race models to see if the route will be doable, both in range and hills.
Where's your high school?
Do they have the ability to do the GT "Old Gold" or whatever color?  The yellow on the card looks kind of like UM of colors.
Also, if this hasn't been pointed out, the code that goes on the simulation side can be found in the network drive under team folders in a folder called 'strategy'.  I imagine some of you have probably seen it already, but that's where it is.
You guys can see the math that goes into post-driving analytics based on _reconTool2.m_ in the post test reconstructions folder.  The actual computation isn't very intensive with the most complex numerical part being the differencing and integration schemes, so I would not worry about the scale being a problem.
  Let me know when you fire it off.  Might want to just go ahead and do that so it's timely.
Fair enough, thanks for edits!
also, the TEFGA picture is actually from CMS...couldn't find a good looking TEFGA photo, but it fits the description
  Possibly send this to the Chic Fil A rep if you think it covers his question well.  Also,  and , CFA wanted a 1 page summary of our Outreach efforts to get an idea of our scope and influence in the local community. I went ahead and threw this together since I had half an hour to spare, hope you don't mind.  The editable word doc is in the following location in the drive: \Team Folders\Outreach Team
Let him know that we'll try to get a sheet of info to him by the end of the day. The main delay not being that we have to prepare it, but finals &amp; stuff :P
Chic Fil A

- Create an Outreach summary  (1 page) for local Atlanta stuff
- Has contacts for AMS, Richard Petty MS, Jack Ralph (?) MS
 .) Use CFA's contact info as a name drop
- Scheller CBA business database (?)
Did they also say if they were hoping for the car to be there, or just posters?  Previously we've just done posters and brought a solar cell or two for tabling.
Got a final at ~11.  I could do in the morning around 9
Thursday right?
Sure
ok
Should it technically say 2017 since we're not using this until 2017?
 I just realized I took the SD card with me... I'm giving it to Sanmesh to give back tomorrow
Fair enough, I've updated the document to match what's on the website.
That document looks pretty good.  I found some minor corrections to make:

*1.)* In the mechanical team section, the "brakes &amp; pedals" team is spelled "breaks and pedals".  Should be the former.
*2.)* In the overall mission section at the beginning, change the part saying that we're "designing" SR2 to "building" it.  We finished 90% of the design last year.
*3.)* SJ-1 is not technically the first solar race car created by the team. Like I linked in the general chat a few weeks ago, there were two cars before it. Not that this matters to companies, but if we were to send this packet to established alumni from the 2003 and 2005 car teams for donations, which has happened, I don't think they'd appreciate being left out.  Neither of those cars were race-eligible, though, so we shouldn't dedicate a lot of time on them.  Instead, say SJ-1 is our first Challenger-class solar car or that it is our first "race-proven" car.
*4.)* Not sure where the specific number of 0.133 came from on the drag coefficient for specs, but it should be changed to "Area Drag Coefficient" with a value of 0.13m^2.
*5.)* In the section talking about ASC, the distances for the cross country race are written to be "&gt;300 mi", but it actually spans over &gt;1000mi.  While &gt;300mi as written is technically correct, &gt;1000mi is more impressive.
*6.)* In the section talking about FSGP, you should change the description of Challenger class to be "cars that are optimized entirely for maximum speed &amp; endurance" instead of saying "for cars built from scratch".  Technically all of the classes, including Cruiser &amp; Adventurer, are built from scratch.
^ Link to the general meeting ppt
As a side note, the answers to the last question of "How is your Hell Week going?" came back as
Yes, I spoke with Sanmesh more about it last night and the inaccessibility and possibility of damage isn't worth it.  We seem to be able to hit max torque as we are, so anything further is just tuning power performance.  Having the airgap be adjustable by a motor would just allow us to optimize motor output for hills vs. flats.  Most motors that I've seen allow for adjustable airgaps, so I do want to ask him why it doesn't have that option.
Because none of the candidates have decided to change running positions, the roster I first posted is the official candidate roster. As a result, the only contested position is for Electrical Lead which is a position that only the electrical team can vote for, meaning that *only electrical team members will be required to vote*. This means that anyone who can't make it that isn't on the electrical team won't need to worry about absentee ballots.  Just wanted to make sure everyone is on the same page.

Again, the last general meeting of the semester will be at 7PM in MRDC2404 with voting happening after general announcements (around 7:15PM).
To clarify, the election will be happening during the usual general meeting at 7PM at MRDC2404.  If you can't make it, message me about sending in an absentee ballot.
I've gone ahead and closed the candidacy application.  So far, the list of people running for positions can be found below:

*President:*              Naim Vasaya
*Chief Engineer:*       Ryan Babaie
*Mechanical Lead:*         Lindsey Berger
*Outreach Lead:*       Tiffany Chau
*Business Lead:*       Kelsey Pepper
*Race Operations Lead:*  Alana Homa

*Electrical Lead:*      Brian Kuo
                      Jared Duncan

The only contested position so far is for the Electrical Lead position, however a final roster will be posted later this afternoon (Nov. 28th).  All candidates need to be prepared to give a speech outlining their platform &amp; goals, regardless of whether or not the position is contested.  More details to come when the roster is finalized.
We've placed the orders for the new MPPTs which will be the time-limiting factor in determining when we mock race, and they will not be available until the start of the Spring semester, so the mock race will not be this semester, but will be one of the first big things we accomplish in the first couple of weeks in Spring 2017.
Could we start working on creating an alumni / history page for the team, perhaps over the break or after finals?  Considering two alumni have reached out already asking for it (one of them is trying to get Li-ion batteries for us, btw), I figure that's a decent excuse to add it.  When you guys are ready, I could help with providing the content for it.
No idea. That alumni might know, but I doubt it. I'd be impressed if they still had any design docs for the old cars.
Check out this motor from the 2003 car's drivetrain.  Some hardcore BLDC action going on with gears, drivebelts, and a duct taped high voltage warning
Sorry for the late night message, but we were recently contacted by a very old alumni from when the team was originally founded (the first time) back in 2002. He sent us some pictures of the very first solar cars made by Solar Jackets back in 2003.  Last year I actually searched for this very same info and managed to only find two pictures, so this is pretty cool.  It's a 2-seater car that was actually driveable and was named "The Good Word".  I put the pictures on the Google Drive for any interested (link below).
just a reminder that we're gonna be having shop work session this evening starting around 7.
According to the ME facilities team, everyone who successfully paid dues several weeks ago should now have buzzcard access to the SCC.  For those who are still on the trial periods, you'll be given the info you need soon.  For any further access issues, *please use the public  channel instead of *.
No meeting in person, just review the slides on your own to stay updated with what's going on.
 Just a reminder that the general shop work day is set for Sunday.
We appear to be missing some of the radios.  Have any of you accidentally taken any of them with you or remember where they might be?
Hey team, this is a reminder that tomorrow will be a shop night (no general meeting) starting around 7 P.M.  Make sure to double check with your subteams later tonight &amp; tomorrow to see when they'll be working.
W:\Team Folders\Electrical Team\Drive Train\Jackson Force Sim
Car is still at McCamish in the trailer btw
we also had GTPD act as chase to get us back to McCamish.  I got a pic of us riding with them and they got some pics with the car too.  The officer that drove is actually in charge of their outreach/social media, so I can give you his info.  He asked for me to send over the pics I took of them helping us anyway
Brian got some sweet pics &amp; vids
mhmm
 who has the padlock key?  Just wanted to make sure somebody has it beforehand
We'd have to be rolling out around then.  I just remember for the drive test at MRDC we took quit a bit of additional time to get everything ready.  Is everything else already ready to go?  Is it actually just show up and go?
Like 6:30
If we still have to move everything me might want to shoot for earlier than 7 just to make sure we're not late
I can get one when I'm near my computer, but if steady state torque at the MRDC was ~80N-m and drew 2kW on a ~103V pack under load, then T/I would be ~4Nm/A
drivetrain efficiency isn't included, and LaTeX sucks
Did your GT login change recently?  I'm able to access it with no problem
Hey team, this is a reminder that tomorrow will be a shop night (no general meeting) starting around 7 P.M.  Make sure to double check with your subteams later tonight &amp; tomorrow to see when they'll be working.
I'm revoking your access because of your comment
yes, michael
The diagram implies they just drag a phone around attached to some string near the rear
Nothing has changed
I was actually just thinking about replacing the motors with more rear wheels, too.  The motor is actually our biggest source of power loss.  Getting rid of it will save us tons.
I like it.
going with BMW wheels because American manufacturing is inherently inferior?
can you send me the video of sanmesh reacting to the radio?
Nothing planned
You'll have to take that up with GTSRHR
I think  had a list of steps for linux users too at some point
Linux OS

1. Stop pretending to be better than everyone else and use Windows
2. ls
Cool slack fact that I just found out from this.  Even though message restricted pinned items only preview part of the pinned item's text, it actually contains all of it, so if you just CTRL+A in the text preview window, you get all of the text again.
No credit cards.  You'll pay them to Kelsey or Kenny.
Lol, if those are 18650's they have nearly 3x as much as we're allowed to have
You'll need a signed, written excuse from the surgeon general, obama, and Rob Manfred, the current Commissioner of Baseball
No general meetings, but work at shop will be ongoing over the break for those that are in town.
I haven't finished doing a robust post-drive data reconstruction, so some of the theoretical results and torque values might seem off, although most of the reconstruction has been done for the 12 minute drive (17_4_3)
W:\Team Folders\Electrical Team\Telemetry\drive test logs\10-2-2016 Tests\MRDC Parking Lot
Preliminary results of the test drive can be found in:
Yes
4/10 is the highest score I can give
Not in crayon or on construction paper
6:30-8

I have a potential race-ops assignment involving test driving the car this week.  We need to test drive the car at a constant speed of about 20MPH and are looking for a good location on or off campus to do it cheaply and with the least amount of logistical effort.  Trying to aim for Thursday, but anywhere from now to Sunday is fair game if it gives us a good location
Send direct messages if you have any conflicts and we can work on a case-by-case basis.
Just a reminder that the meeting is at 7PM in MRDC 2404 (the usual spot).  The regs quiz will happen near the middle of the meeting after general announcements, but try to arrive as on time as possible to not miss it.  It will consist of 12 questions and will take 10 minutes.  The quiz will be completed via google forms, so *you will need your laptop, so bring your laptop*.  Also, just to clarify when results will be out, the trial period results will likely be sent out on Wednesday (not before the meeting).
"New member info package" is what you guys should have access to so far unless your subteam has given you access to specific things to work on
Also, make sure to bring your laptops tomorrow to take it.  It'll probably take about 5-10 minutes.
social experiment*
I see your pointless debate and raise it with an even worse one
Just a reminder that the communal shop day will be on Saturday (tomorrow), mainly because:
(1) No football
(2) Ray Day is on Sunday and most of last year's members are going to be there for most of the day.

Like before, times to show up vary depending on when your subteam plans to show up, but most people get there between 10-12
Fits like a glove
Let your subteam lead know you'll be late because of the test and they can either debrief you or give you a copy of the slides
 your order of small wire, D-subs, switches, and tubing came in and is on electrical's delivery rack
It's mainly the electrical subteam leads with the target of finishing re-assembly and debugging of the drivetrain starting at 8.  You can come if you like, but be warned that there's not going to be a whole lot of work/time for explaining things for this session, unfortunately.  Trying to get the systems working for CMS as fast as possible.
6-8.  I think they're still doing on-campus interviews.
 we can one-up them if we can figure out how to get us on the cover of a Wheaties box.
they were in their superbowl commercial, too
a spherical hot dog
do we really want someone representing us that doesn't even know how to microwave a hot dog?
yup.
I'm registered.  I enjoyed the adrenaline rush of being timed when making the account.
Anyone know if we have sticker nametags?
since we're gonna be doing for free, I don't think you need to enter it.  Should be a non-essential field
Student orgs can use the SC plasmas for static slides for free up to 2 weeks.
Like the board looks brown
The brown ones that is
One with red LEDs.   I believe they're all of similar size
Molly and I made a word doc about sponsorship levels with SR2 items on it.  Might need to update that.  Some of the FedEx ppts about SR2 at a high level can also be repurposed.
Change Eagle to CadSoft
Atlantic station, maybe.  Or cookout
  It looks like we already submitted an order for 30 bypass diodes on 6/14 from Mouser (required to finish the array).  Can we confirm that they've arrived?
No, we should be good
Apparently extra solar cells are in, will swing by and get those tomorrow.
 This pdf contains all of the reports related to the electrical systems of the car.  Please read through it and let me know if you can find anything wrong.       especially.  The mech sections are blank as we are writing the mech report now, but will send in the electrical reports ahead of time.  The electrical documentation begins in Section 4, page 9 of this version.  Looking to send this out preferably tomorrow
Cool, just wanted to make sure
 Can whoever has the BMS from Manzanita post the contents of the delivery here to make sure it all came in?
Can't guarantee that, Dr. Cheung hasn't responded.  Will Edo still be there?
Every livestock company has a branding office
We could've bought eco car
That's the price of a camaro
The smaller one couldn't handle the load running through it
Same one posted in here
Windows OS will just be for programming
 Yes
Batteries are also set to come in next week on June 14th
Otherwise that topology &amp; configuration I showed you guys should work
   :  Some useful information I got from Rich (BMS guy).  The idea to hook up the BMS's non-sequentially is a no-go.  Definitely don't do that, they don't work like that.  The start-up time for the MKs to latch the main contactors is something we'll need to experiment with, but according to him, it could be ~15 seconds.  We should revisit the car start-up mechanisms to adjust for this.  Also, in the system topology I made, I drew the SoC and MK's on separate chains.  They recommend that we keep them all chained together instead.
I asked him to in order to keep us under $2500 so we can deal with less of GT bureaucracy.  He said they didn't have a budget aside for anything larger (they probably don't, it's a small company).  I also spoke with him for an hour about his idea to recreate the ASC, but to make solar powered ATV's that ride across Alaska, so ya, some kind of a discount was in order.
10%, by the way, won't qualify him for anything (total cost is ~$2500 pre-discount)
   BMS ordering is good to go.  Just got off the phone with Rich and convinced him to give us 10% off plus some additional hardware that we'll need to work around the no-CAN problem.  I'm going to email them tomorrow, and when they've confirmed the discount we can order.
Kind of, SBM was waiting to send me costs until after they'd manufactured.   but if you need an invoice for the 10th deadline I can see about it
Yes
ASC does need to be on
No fancy colors, just the models
Hayden and I are gonna get some finished (from the outside anyway) models today to be used for it.
who watches the watchmen...someone has to care about SBM :stuck_out_tongue:
^ correct, eagle is just the product/program.  The logo you showed me is fine though, Ruchi
:flag-us::flag-us::flag-us::flag-us::flag-us::flag-us:
Correct, they're still being flipped.  The schematics are just functional other than physical E-stop locations
think this might be similar if not about the same. Found this in the shop
PN: ACS758, LCB-100B, 310DXAA
No, the motor takes in 3-phase AC as the input.  The batteries output DC.  The MC acts as an inverter to change the current type.  Need to have it attached to the line going from batteries to motor
What do we feed it to sense current?
How exactly is that current sensor going to be mounted?  Is it intended for a board?
Should be visible coming up to the campanile now.  If you're not there, start going to the campanile
ETA likely 12:10
This waterjetting session brought to you by the letter "O"
^ strike 2
^This is for full team, btw.  Also, last meeting of the semester tonight.  Same time, same place.
 Final picture postponement: We're moving it to *tomorrow (Wed.) at noon by the Campanile*.  Wear blue shirts or GTSR polos if you have one.  If you show up late, you'll have to photoshop yourself in.  We will be bringing the car with us and will be unloading near the Culc circle, so if you're early, be on the look out for the trailer to help unload Stella.
On our way back with the motor controller materials
Yup
Yup, got the receipt
 As a reminder, general meeting tonight at 7 in MRDC 2404
3.3V
also, apparently it works best with salt water.  maybe we can add them when we retrofit SR2 into a solar boat
By the time they get the efficiency from 6.53% to un-doped Si's level (maybe 27% by then) we'll probably be on SR8, but maybe
The current that goes to the motor does go through the controller to be inverted from DC to AC.  The current sensors we need are for the main power lines, so 100A.  We don't necessarily need to know the power lowering the controller
#TBT
On the website it says a 10-pack will get quantity discount, lowering it to $64.60, but that isn't reflected in the final checkout window.  Part seems correct, though
I have the converter now
  full antennae kit (with modems and boards) arrived.  I have them sitting next to me in the office.
Do you guys have any use for the old Solar Jackets banner that used to hang up in the shop?  Otherwise we're gonna throw it out
even if you've already told me, re-confirm to ensure you're included
 If you're here over spring break and want to do work, please message me, kenny, or hayden
Hayden and I are on our way with the trailer.  Should be there right around 2 in the back
Updated with stuff for SR2 for TEFGA (don't judge me being awake at 4 am)
for all of the designed brackets, at least.
do we have all of the metal we need otherwise?
ya sure, beat my hi-score and then _maybe_ we can start talking about my severance package
  what's the deal with rides to the event?
as a note,   himself made this
Outreach team, start making posters featuring this ASAP and put them around Klaus.  Guaranteed recruitment strategy for CS majors
I was looking for specs for Iowa State's solar car (their team is named PRISUM) and found this.  Apparently there is a manga about solar car racing called "Donten Prism Solar Car".  Just thought I'd throw this out there
The 4th one is at Comprent
Other potential media material of us building the MDF plugs
hmm, seems to only break there if you've never navigated to the teams page before.  Try it in incognito to see what I mean
ah, if you navigate to "our teams" and do it, it works fine.  However, if you click on the images on the homepage, those are the ones that are broken for me
Is it still updating to the rolled back version?  Seems like the links to individual teams like electrical or mechanical are broken
tried emailing him?
    what's the progress on the website?
 Reminder that there's a meeting tonight at 7 in the usual place.  Topics will include updates on progress for the major systems of the car as well as information about the race team, what positions are available, and how to apply a few weeks down the road.
 This is a reminder that we'll be having the weekly general body meeting at 7.  This is also the due date for the extra $15 dues that we mentioned 2 weeks ago.
Sub-team / project leads and up
I am in the conference room right now and will be keeping my stuff there.  If I'm not there, I am probably near the composites area.  Goes without saying, but make sure you give the money to me in person and don't just leave it on my laptop :stuck_out_tongue:
For those interested, I found some pictures of the team from 2003.  After 2003, the team was disbanded until around 2008 when the SAEV Audi project started, giving momentum to the team to start building competitive cars around 2011-2012 (SJ1).  Anyway, I managed to find some pictures of the car they built back then called "The Good Word" as well as some other pictures of '03 Atlanta in the album linked.  Cool stuff, yo
website up
Website is back up!  Shout out to  and any who helped.
why yes.  yes it is.
this is why we can't have nice things
The car is now capable of distributing power from the batteries to all auxiliary electrical systems and can be charged with the solar array.
Small repairs to the motor controller controller board are holding up the motor from spinning, but otherwise SR1 is electrically functional
 Are you taking it out of shipping today or tomorrow?
me irl....
The rest of SR2's cf is in
Their official hours of operation are 8am-4:30pm (pretty sure they always leave a little before 4).  I'd imagine 8-10:30 or 1:00-3:30 would be good hours.  You can also call/email Kenny Garrick to check if it's open
party like it's 1989
chill
3/8" A-36 HR Steel Plate from Metals Depot (1' W, 2' L) has arrived in shop.
Carbon fiber tubes from Rockwest composites are in (Bharat's possession).
Yes, I was going to announce it in just a bit.  Except at 6:30
To clarify for anyone confused, by "6 o'clock meeting", I mean a leaders meeting at 6 with the general meeting at 7
 hey guys, there's gonna be a 6 o'clock meeting today.  Sorry for the last-minute update
Not impressed
&gt;still using fluorescent lights and not LEDs

Shouldn't take long, but be available from 10-11
   Since you guys weren't able to make the mechanical meeting yesterday, you have been selected to represent GTSR at the IS waterjet clean out at 10am on Friday (Dec. 4).  This is a great honor that we expect you to uphold.  If you cannot make it due to class conflict, let me know *today*.  Otherwise, see you there!

Delaying to 11, classroom doesn't open until then
If you have a structured presentation ready, go ahead and put it in "Critical Systems PPTs" folder under mechanical on the drive
you non-louisianians crack me up
pffft, you call this weather bad?  you telling me you people don't own your own life rafts?
 pictures tonight, show up at 6:30 with your polo if you have one
It gets better....just wait
Yo yo yo, no pre-meeting meeting today, just a heads up
 mech meeting happening?
always remember to leave room in your life for the based god
i dont see any lil' b, zack
 Just like last week, I'd appreciate it if everyone in charge of a project group or sub-team could be in MRDC2404 at 6:30.  Thanks.
Because Michigan would then just heli-drop in their spare car and win
We could also put a large EMP device in our car and detonate it at the starting line and ruin everyone's electronics.  Except for ours.  Because they never worked?  No.  They were shielded in our trailer which is wrapped in a faraday cage sandwiched with boPET polyester film.  Replace electronics.  Game set match 2nd place guaranteed
Heading there in just a sec
Wingate is the machine design professor?
Who is at shop right now?
Don't provoke my inhuman side, Kenny.  Nobody is above sorting resistors in the electrical gulag
pretty much the whole day, Hayden too
I'll be there in the morning as well
Similar transaction conversion to using g dogecoin
Gotcha, thanks Kenny
ya
figuring out hangouts

aint none of yall even close to brains's email:  whewlad69
this is just disgusting
People also have the right to be exiled to the GTSR Gulag
 can be your first target
Treat them as lesser human beings until they change their ways
I was going to wait until the meeting tonight to announce this, but I would like to start a campaign of bigotry and intolerance toward people that use yahoo mail
for you guys to see as well

 Happy birthday dood
Doing the solar car overview thing tomorrow at 11 in the MRDC btw if any of you want to go
cool^3
So you think it'd be good to send after we do a group critique at the Mech meeting tonight?
you've got the wheels rolling through*
Is it close enough?  The things they'll be looking for are co-planar faces and easy to access holes ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°).  To my knowledge we haven't updated it with what they've initially told us when we met them last week.  Are you saying the dimensions and layout are pretty much set?
Cool, that's what I was hoping to hear.  Just get it close enough for them to evaluate it and give suggestions on the overall design.  The FEA is more for us, so if we can just run the worst cases and gauge that the design is "good to ship" we can look at any intermediate cases on our own time.  Thanks d00ds
We need to be designing the uprights in tandem with their suggestions which means this process can't be done last minute.  At the very least I'd say we need a full week of business days of correspondence to do this properly
That's not enough time
Is it against policy for them to do so?  Also, does that mean the stuff we've ordered before and "lost" was never signed for too, or is that just for this case?
Does anyone know why we can't ship to the SCC?  I still don't understand
 Meeting tonight in MRDC 2404.  Sub-team leads &amp; mentors meeting at 6.
(c00l).^3
And that's cool.  I met with Mitsuba over the Summer actually (they came by GM and I spoke with them in Jankanese).  The people I know in CalSol said Mitsuba often broke on them, although Tokai used them on their Challenger.  Do you know if your new friend deals with any other collegiate teams?
Don't watch an anime called boku
So just to clarify (I'll send an email to the mentors mail chain for those not on Slack), those of you that are mentors only need to be there *for your group*.  The people that need to be there for the entire eval duration are sub-team leads and up.  Mentors are more than welcome to sit in on the evals and contribute to the discussion, but it's not mandatory for them to be there.
Classic suspension team
mmm, Papa Kenny's apartment
 Make sure you have your teams somewhere on the eval schedule
TBD, but it'll either be central campus or MRDC
go home, john, you're drunk
what meeting?
.......get da water
we could either make it out of anti-matter, or we just don't make it.  But not making it isn't enough.  We have to *really* not make it.  Like she has to not exist harder than things that don't normally exist
idk, ask Piper if she can get us some
we'd have to make her out of anti-matter
taking up negative space
she'd have to negatively not exist to break a record
even with the power of the sun at her disposal....nope
even with 100% efficient cells
the answer is no
just ran some calculations to see if stella could ever break a world record for speed
If it comes to it, we can machine it in-house.  But we should gun as hard as we can to get it machined elsewhere.  I don't like thinking of that as a plan B, because I don't want us to rely on it.  But if we have to...*have to*...we can
the sentiment that I got from the mechanical team in the equivalent of giant, size 72 all caps bolded text was that they don't want to machine anything that'll be on the motor or motor assembly
Can anyone be at shop around 4 to watch my group?  I have a research meeting then and can't go
so I'm not talking about just the waterjet.  This is for cleaning in general, IS, SCC, anything we use and need to take care of
so, just to clarify, the next mandatory sub-team for waterjet is going to be Metals, for PCB milling: Hardware.  If we have enough notice, we'll announce it and take volunteers
Just a quick quip about cleaning facilities: we're going to institute a policy of having a rolling roster of sub-teams that will be responsible for cleaning when we are called upon to do it.  If we have enough notice to plan, we'll do volunteer sign-ups.  However, if the notice is last minute, we'll have sub-teams and upper leads go to cleaning, and it will be *mandatory*.  The cleaning will be sub-team specific, so for waterjet, the list will be Metals, Composites, Logistics, Power Systems, so if power did it last week, composites goes this week.  For PCB milling, it'll be teams like hardware, power, software.  If we have enough volunteer sign ups, we won't make it mandatory, but it is *absolutely crucial* that Solar Racing plays a part in maintaining our facilities.  If we lose access to the IS and other facilities right in the middle of our build cycle, we're boned.
Using springs is not a bad idea. Probably wouldn't bother with torsional. Would just use hinges and a normal spring.
Reminder that we have shop today. Couple of highlights that we'll be focusing on:
&gt; *Frame:* Mule chassis construction and prep for SR-2 rear bracket welding
&gt; *Aero*: Tool cleaning, battery box kevlar rebonding, preparing staging for the MDF stack-up
&gt; *Suspension*: Uninstall the rear suspension - prepare for cutting and welding this weekend
&gt; *Steering*: Steering wheel prototyping
&gt; *Batteries*: Get BoM ready _tonight_ so we can prepare purchasing process. Begin laying out components in the box mock-up
&gt; *Aux Systems*: Check in with me about aux array - need to finalize wiring diagram (sicheng)
&gt; *Powertrain*: Check out steering's wheel - discuss upgrades and changes
&gt; *Solar*: Check in again about aux array. Need to find a way for us to be able to use that aux array with SR-2 potentially for mock racing
&gt; *Telemetry*: RF testing and start scoping out SMS texting

These are items at the minimum that I'd like for us to focus on. There's more to do, but these are some critical items to either start, do, or discuss. If you're an owner for one of these items and won't be here, please send me a DM.
I'm trying to describe it to sanmesh and can't do it jus:ti:ce
Hey does anyone have the brisket pic of jus:ti:n lee
It's like 2 weeks old, but just seeing it now
you _could_ taper it like the body will be, but we can always just get that milled out.
1" on either side (2" total) on the stackup
% thickness is relative - if it was multiplied by the wrong length, you'll get the wrong absolute width
For the mule chassis
Same % thickness, or same absolute width
Also  what's the order of cuts you're preparing with respect to position on the car?
 6" bending die radius, correct?
Also 
Regarding the draft angle - yes, I can include more of a draft. We're actually running low on solar array space when taking into account SBM's encapsulation on our most recent sunpower batch, so I'm likely going to narrow the bottom/widen the top, and try to create shoulders along the edge anyway. That should provide a lateral draft angle when pulling the part up.

Regarding the wheel space - we'll see what we can do. The options are to make the body wider (explained below, not very bueno), bring the trackwidth in (not great for stability), or bring the front wheels rearward (reduces egress space by bringing steering tube toward the driver). I'll pursue them in reverse order, which is my preference. Making the aerobody more narrow in the front is not fantastic - it can have pretty huge impacts on our drag (if you're curious, the imgur link shows the progression of the first 5 lower hull iterations. From 1-5 the drag was cut in half by extending the length of the body that has a "rising" profile).
It's definitely an improvement concept-wise. Just need to make sure the planform stays the same
enclosure dims are linked a few pictures up the chat
simplest thing we can work with first, maybe upgrade later if we like it
^ This is like a semi-meme pet project btw... most of it was done as a break from main SR-3 work on Saturday. Mostly just keeping everyone up to do date in the event we decide we want to buy/make these. We'll have a review before anything is purchased on the team's dime.

It's been kept simple enough that the odds of working/not working are entirely tied to the barometer and Rx/Tx setup, so it's a pretty minimum viable product. But again, it's an accessory not on our main mission list, so before we dedicate anyone's time assembly/test we'll review it first
Do you guys want to meet up later today to finalize the BoM? If we can't, I can throw whatever has been left out together, including the kevlar/core, tonight, but it'd be good for everyone to know what we're about to purchase. It'd also be a good chance to make sure everyone is aware of the construction process (including the box) and caveats that will come with this design (e.g. we need much smaller fans...)
If we could tack on getting an exhaustive list of necessary tooling for every component in its most complex potential form (i.e. if we have 1.5" swing arms instead of 0.75") I think that'd make for a good use of this week.
Considering the frame will use ~8 and the suspension and other brackets will require several others, too, that seems fine with me.  for awareness
We don't have to keep them either - if it sits pretty snuggly in your hand while reaching for buttons we could just cover it with padding. Thought it might be interesting to try out
 Just curious - how are the little finger bumps in terms of comfort? They were eyeballed, but just curious if they're actually ok here.
You can buy them alone...should be on their website 
We are in 2404 for the meeting 
Good job on the kick off everyone. I know it was a lot of work getting everything together after only 2 weeks of working in-person, but I think we've done a really good job thinking through our options, coming up with solutions, and keeping this design simple, flexible, and practical. It's amazing how much more detailed this was compared to the soft kick off one month ago. At this point I'd argue our  design is even more detailed/thought out than SR-2's was last January. I think we've got a lot to be excited about with this car and I can't wait to see it start materializing. I think we're going to be pretty amazed at how quick and easy this can be.

With the kick off behind us, we have a good baseline to iterate off of. At this point it's critical that _everyone_ understands this design and stays  up to date on the changes. Development  is going to continue to be quick, so now is the best chance to catch up and stay up to date by reading the ppts, watching the recording, and asking tons of questions. Tomorrow I'll send out some updates on refocused efforts to close out our "big three" designs/send them to ASC, as well as starting prefab and fab of our prototypes and battery pack.

Once again, well done everyone - both to the presenters and those of you in the audience thinking critically about each system's choices. If you have any concerns or questions (even "dumb" ones) feel free to shoot a message in the subteam's channel or just shoot me a DM.
Links about to be posted, hang tight
Hey everyone, SR-3 kick-off will be today at 2:30 PM in MRDC 2404 and will likely last until 7. Each subteam will be discussing their current designs, manufacturing plans, and timeline, so it'll be a long meeting. However, I don't expect everyone to be there the entire time. I'll be posting up an agenda of when subteams will be going up to talk. It's perfectly fine for you to dip in for the subteams you're immediately interested in, although I encourage to you to listen in on as many as you can. Each subteam will be open for questions, so this is a good chance to double check their work. While this is not an official design closeout for all systems, we will begin prefab for a lot of our larger systems and begin prototype building for many of the others, so make sure to turn out and give your comments.

If you can't make it in person, I'll be recording everything on our YouTube account and broadcasting over Hangouts. Hope to see you guys there!
From talking around it seems most of us are in consensus on sticking with the 5x7 configuration for the immediate next revision
Good for you
Escaping the mcwastle cooking pit is really hard
It's been a ride
Still working on it
 we goin to Fellini's, Wendy's is broken 
Okily dokily, let's come to a consensus on what to do for SR-3. The test, while confidence-building, certainly doesn't confirm this pack is completely fixed. The removal of the voltage offsets does more for me personally to give hope that it's not a fundamental design issue. The other issue of bus bar contact seen at the race should be covered by the garolite switch and addition of the spacers. Right now the strings are rock solid stiff, even with the poly. To confirm the problem is _gone_ is going to require tons of drive time that only builds confidence instead of offering an absolute gaurantee it's fixed. Even after 320 miles of driving, if the "run-away" of BMS shut-offs happens, then pretty much any confidence we had that we fixed the issue is shattered...so setting that drive time criteria is going to be really arbitrary unless we do some bayesian update black magic probability to calculate a statistical target. This becomes a decent threat to our schedule if we gate SR-3 pack development to meeting that drive time target.

If we started with $3000 of new cells, we could probably pursue other configurations, but with the constraint of re-using what we have I think this 5x7 setup is our best option for a stable pack that we can build and test quickly with enough time left over to start entirely from scratch without bleeding into the summer.

In general, are we confident to proceed with the above design concept along with the improvements we've made? The above concept being to still press the contacts and stand the modules upright using garolite sheets and metal bolts with VHB applied to the intrastring connections.
Should be good now
Thoughts on lid mechanisms? Thinking hinges will be nice for sure, although there's some discussion on that front to be had on whether it should open sideways or longways. I'm a fan of sideways, but while in the car the ribs will stop it from going past 90 degrees, so it'll probably fall back on you while working on it. Length-wise has some issues of easily ripping out the hinges or blocking a ton of stuff when flipped open toward the tail (it'd block the MPPTs and connectors, for example).
^ Images of the pack that should be useful for creating functional maps of wires. This'll be useful to make sure we've allocated enough space for everything or if the box needs to somehow be made larger
An interesting consequence of this is that to move the WS more rearward, we need to shrink the footprint of the precharge battery (see pack image in the album) 
It's the radius where the base of the canopy intersects with the array
at the base of the airfoil
You'd have to increase the thickness of the airfoil to get more space - I just recommend increase the radius at the base
Checking that it won't explode from the tire's pressure compared to ambient. As a side note, I goofed in a good way and put the full 70 psi instead of the delta b/w that and ambient, making it more like ~55 psi, so making this from 3D printed material with solid infill might actually work
Under 70 psi it seems like it'll be reasonable for it to live
The orifices could also be moved to the ABS piece so it's just a simple bore and tap for the adapter
As a side note, the valve stem pusher could be replaced by a smol bolt through the top of the adapter if lathing the extrusion is too difficult.
Ya, same one as used for the soft kick off and the presentations thus far (the one you made)
Go ahead create some slides based on the deliverables using that same template. We'll figure out how to best compile them tomorrow
Basically
  Thoughts?
Another solution might be to go with a non-circular rotation path (like an ellipse) or follow the profile of a hook
Sorry for the late night announcement. A lot of subteams are very close to having their kick-off deliverables met, but could definitely use some final reviews/discussions before being presented. Since we have the 3-day weekend ahead of us, *we'll be moving the kickoff to Monday, 9/3*.

The purpose of the kick-off is to ensure that our baseline designs will both satisfy our performance/reg requirements, but also confirm that we have the flexibility within those designs to improve/iterate with later revs and ensure that we haven't locked ourselves into a risky situation (e.g. before locking down a leading arm suspension, confirm our frame/steering/aerobody allow us to modify/adapt to any foreseeable issues we might have). The key here is for us to make sure we know what we're getting into, make sure we thoroughly understand the risks associated with each system, and confirm that we have contingencies if we're not able to beat those risks. The format of the kick-off will be just like the soft presentation I gave one month ago, except we will also include a timeline for remaining design and manufacturing for the year and each subteam will present their system, requirements, design, and manufacturing process (see the deliverables in the previously linked slides). The kick-off will be recorded and made accessible over hangouts for anybody out of town to tune in and present.

Once again, sorry for the late announcement. For those that'll be here we'll be *having regular shop on Sunday* with a focus on kick-off preparation. I'll also be here all day today (9/1) fleshing out designs and supporting battery testing. Feel free to shoot me any questions you might have.
Let me know if you want me to direct you to CAD. Do you have solidworks ?
Could we throw together a diagram showing the physical routing path tonight?
Ok good, thanks
And an initial idea for how to reach the pack connectors
Included in the imgur link is the battery cradle structure that will attach the pack to the frame
Ya each layer - sorry, so the perimeter of your layers consists of entirely straight lines?
The natural consequence here is that you'll need to take out the 4th string to get to the 5th string...I personally don't think that's a deal-breaker, but it's worth discussing.
One thing to note on the content above - going with the 5x7 configuration does result in the positive and negative sides of the pack being on opposite ends (since the number of strings is odd). I discussed this with  the other day and we explored a couple of options including having a copper plate run underneath the final string to route the positive end back, but a wire over the top seems the easiest.
Since it's so condensed, doing a vehicle-wide wiring diagram with detail to the connector level might be too dense, especially since 90% of the action is in the dashboard. I think a vehicle-wide diagram of harnesses going to a "black box" dashboard that then has its own diagram would make sense.
If we go with the tablesaw method, do we know what our stack-ups would look like?  
 Could you give a quick update on aux systems kickoff readiness? I think the only thing that we're missing is the high voltage, low voltage wiring diagrams - not sure if we've started on those
 Mind giving a quick update on powertrain kickoff readiness?
Any chance we could format that drawing to physically match the wiring layout per board connector? Basically what you've got here, but with each block's connectors/pins defined
shows what I know
ah
hey are you in california by any chance?
/advice 
thanks 
maybe this has something to do with our emails?
it doesn't work anymore
/advice is dead
Was $400/hr their quoted price? If so that is incredibly steep. At our fastest we could do maybe 2 sheets an hour last year, so even with that lower bound that's incredibly expensive (it does validate your estimate, though)
Rotationally lock
If we locked the nut in physically, you would need to get a socket back there. You could just line the nut up to the hole and then rotate the bolt head from the outside. If we did it right the nut wouldn't be able to free spin
From the array to the MPPT's, we could have the box come up to the same height as the battery box floor and have a harness connector for array power. Within, would recommend we give preference to what we're most comfortable with. If we think terminal blocks are good for power distribution and easy to access, we can just go for that.
Separate slides would make more sense
 Did you get any pics of the photon stack-up you CAD'ed yesterday?
One improvement could be to show how the parts would be oriented when doing the operation on them. Like for the holes, indicating that you have the flat back of the control arm's "neck" to give you a stable surface for drilling all of the holes
Just an example of what you could do (I think this level of detail is aight for the kick-off) - here I just covered the entire part with an extrude of its bounding size
Also ya, maybe for those you can just cover up the cuts with an extrude
never
Ok, I'll head over in a few
Anyone else able to come in?
Ok, I'll probably go in around 7'ish after talking with suspension
 ?
Additionally,  have you had a chance to try out any steering effort calculations? Do you want to sit down and go over it some time?
Gotcha, sounds fine - thanks for checking
Dang, ok so, 9/4 and 9/10
  Any updates on if we were able to get a prototype steering wheel in to print?
Good with 6?
How about MRDC
I'm thinking of mixing it up
Be there in 10
Probably biggest thing to discuss is loading philosophy, remaining brake mount, and manufacturing plan. Probably like 1-2 hours tbh, maybe less
Other than 3-4, any time works for me
Honestly, we're going to probably implicitly follow a '"standard" anyway (e.g. "make your bracket look more like these"). Question is if you'd like to compile it so bracket design is incredibly predictable. I think it'd be very worth.
Is it possible for us to continue pack work today maybe some time around 6 or 7 for a couple hours?
  (and anyone else who wants to join) would you guys have time today to talk about remainder of kick off objectives for suspension?
Is that a jojo reference?
why
lol
I can come by for about 30 minutes
would anyone be willing to give a couple of late night battery lads a ride home from shop?
Classic Obama-era weakness
They did wreck us in that robot battle 
Steven in solar is going to CAD up the concepts prior to Saturday so we can choose which ones to try out
Yes, we have two options - go with another four bar linkage with smaller rods attached to the frame (they'll stay there, so no deployment) or put a locking hinge system at the aerobody wall
_Another diplomat said that he could not explain Trump’s Pearl Harbor reference but added that the president relishes historical references and frequently brings up Japan's “samurai past.”_
It's included in the reaction loads from the spindle
I did some initial hand calcs for sizing it. And no we do assume everything takes the bump load with the arms. All the uprights will see, though, are reaction loads at the spindle mount and a steering load that the knuckle mount 
Is it possible to include the connector locations/orientation in the diagram for each board?
  With the frame FEA mostly run (without roll cage), do we have bandwidth to hit the other kickoff target of identifying locations for all major brackets for regs-required systems (ballast, seat, seatbelts, etc.)? Would it help to meet tomorrow to discuss this?

As a side note, the waterjet was online yesterday and we used it to cut battery pack parts, however we encountered an issue with it that I'm hoping Jason can resolve in time for shop, so we might be able to get the suspension brackets cut and prefabbed (weld the brackets themselves) for frame attachment this week.
Sounds good
Something is blocking the waterflow so instead of all going out of the nozzle, it's going through the garnet feed hole
It's not the solenoid, it's the venturi on the probe side
If you can do 2017, that's preferred rn
W:\Team Folders\Mechanical Team\CAD
Added a shortcut in the mechanical CAD folder
When do we think we can get a physically-representative functional 2-D schematic drawn up of the dashboard interior?
Gotcha
Like we don't have a few extra inches?
Did we order to that level of precision with our lengths of tube?
Order another bar? You could just use the one that was going to be straight
How bad is the twisting? If you're applying all of the stub-adapter loads on the bottom through the bolt holes it might be under-estimating the torsion we'll see both from bumping (since the swing arm is offset to the wheel's vertical axis) and turning. In that case it'd be applying the loads right where I have that main outer load path. Instead it'd actually distribute the force across the face of the stub adapter (so that entire face before the webbing)
Ya, if it was just the box we could maybe get around it by making the box provide that angle instead, but with roof-mounted pedals we definitely need the mule chassis to have the correct profile, otherwise the pedals could be like 6" off vertically
The reason I bring that up is that you're seeing no stress on the part that actually holds the caliper. It looks like you could theoretically make those load paths incredibly small and far less thick which doesn't really match what I'd expect.
Ya, the scenario that I think of is one where we've just bottomed out the shock to its max stroke and can't rotate anymore but are still taking the full bump, so in this case it'd be like 800 lbs down at the spring bracket holes and along with the full bump-induced moments.
Oh ok, I can kind of see that now in how it's bending the base bracket. One thing that I thought about when doing the front brake knuckle FEA was about how, when I only constrained the holes, it made the base where those holes were deflect when in reality they have a solid surface (the upright) behind them to transfer those loads. I applied a custom constraint to the base face (the side facing the solid surface) so it couldn't deflect into the solid. Got very different results that made a lot more sense.
Nah, did reply to them, but need a shipping address
Also, shoulder width
Is this with the spring load, braking load, or both?
 I just realized that since we want to have a roof-mounted pedal rack and since the dashboard relies on the frame to provide its viewing angle (wrt to the driver) we may need to make the front of the mule chassis have the same profile as the real frame (from a side-view)
Ok, we could load up the car tomorrow night then. I don't think we'll be needing it for anything between the end of Tuesday and start of Thursday
You mean hooking it to the F350 or loading up the car? We can load up the car the night before at the end of shop.
An estimate to within half a foot is totally fine
     Could you guys approximate your torso height (hip to top of your head) and "leg" length (hip to foot) to within like half a foot in a thread below this message?
I haven't really sat down to do the full FBD if you want to look at it. It really should just be a direct reaction of moment into the stub axle mounting holes
Just to clarify, we cleaned the solenoid and feeding tube. The issue seems to be that the hole for garnet feeding on the nozzle-side is driving water into the tube instead of operating like a Venturi, so we think either that hole is clogged (already tried blowing it out) or maybe some of the orifices in the nozzle are
Modified the dashboard to be more like the box mock-up (easier to make without the drooped snoot). The angle of the main longitudinal frame members does in fact work out where we won't need the droop, so we should be good to just make box, mount it directly, and call it good.
How direct is directly behind? In that picture it's 2" behind the display. And are we using that for each LCD, or one to drive all of them?
Those long aluminum parts actually are the pedals 
We'll do our best, but I'm curious if you see a feasible (easy) alternative that can guarantee water tightness to that IP standard you usually source to.

If we make a box that fits together well enough that we actually need our tolerancing, I think by default it will aptly protect against spraying. We can have holes at the back for drainage since the entire thing slopes down. Otherwise I think building to a tight fit should probably do very well.
 HyTech actually has a pretty simple pedal rack that you could look at too. It even has the whole platform on a rail so you can adjust the position pretty easily.
The other board was the display board (not sure if we'd have one for each)
I think just building a box is fine. I know we think we can't figure it out from a data point over a year ago, but I'm pretty sure we can build a box like this out of plastic sheets.
 wanted to consolidate RF and 4G to a mega
We could avoid the weird droop in the middle of the box by having the dash panel hang back behind the green tube. It'd be further away from the driver (would need to test if that distance is un-usable), but then the enclosure becomes a lot simpler to make.
My arteries would beg to differ
:cookout: :f:
Spread the word
The Chipotle and Zaxby's behind Ikea are both real, although I don't think the Zaxby's has officially opened yet
No, the wood is in our new space though
Sounds good!
Wanna swing by around 3:30?
I'll be hanging around shop doing follow ups with a few teams if anyone wants to join in. In general we're going to keep official shop times dedicated to physical work outside of our office, so off-days/hours like this are good opportunities to do computer and design work.
:triggered: 
  do you guys have time to swing by shop and talk about frame follow-ups from Wednesday? Additionally I'd like to come to a consensus on the wing designs and maybe run some load cases with and without them.
Basic principle to calculate the sideward moment that steering would have to fight in a sidewind is to
&gt; Estimate the location of the center of pressure (it's the area centroid of the top)
&gt; Calculate the distance between the center of pressure and center of gravity
&gt; Idealize the bottom hull as an airfoil - pull from the CAD and import into XFOIL
&gt; Calculate the sideslip angle as *atan(V_side / V_freestream)*
&gt; Run XFOIL with the airfoil at that wind angle
&gt; Extract the CL and CM
&gt; Calculate the dynamic pressure as (0.5*rho*V^2)
&gt; Calculate the lift-induced moment and yaw moment from the airfoil (using CM)
&gt; Combine the two to get total moment induced at the center of pressure

We'll then see what that value looks like and decide if we need to run CFD to get a more detailed answer. This is semi-conservative since the real center of pressure will be closer to the CG.
I'm wearing the solar polo and jeans
It's a little rough, but I'm hoping it should be sufficient to support whatever discussions we end up having
 How compatible with frunk storage would you say your current aux array design is?
Also, you can see how the steering knuckle hardware would fit in - should be double in those spaces if we keep that structure
Bolts are just going through them - they're just there so the top/bottom plates can't deflect downward when we bolt them together
I'm thinking we'll just hold it up, cut to a drawn length that overestimates slightly, and then just eyeball until we're good, then use that one as a baseline for the others
:wewlad:
I have a meeting at 4, can catch you after, though
no, my apartment
FYI it runs, but it's filled with garnet, so we need to do the clean out
I'll need a ride to pick them up. I'd be fine with doing that if we have a waterjet that we can use.
Not sure

 Did you get any pictures of Novum's array stand (or Novum in charging configuration)?
All good ?
Sorry about that - gsuite has extra settings that I had to change. Should be able to view them now
So no big decision making, just general info? I'm trying to set up official ones for kick off prep, so if your meeting isn't trying to be that, then it's good/no worries, otherwise we'll want to make the invite roster more formal
From dynamics
Did we get any good pics of destroyed tires?
Noice!
Could someone find the videos of us nyooming through figure 8 before we started scrutineering?
Could you just DM a quick link to one of the pics if you can find a good one?
Does anyone have pictures of the array damage from the race?
This is just for general awareness, but I measured out what 5083-H116 stock we had lying around shop and got these dimensions:
17x17x6
6x11x3
8.5x4.5x2.5
(two of these ^^)
17.5x8.5x3.25
6.5x5x3.5 (from leftover upright stock, x2)

This is actually enough to make everything except for the uprights with enough left over for multiple tries. The front bottom control arms and rear swingarm, for example, are 3/4" aluminum, so there's enough to make two of each piece for each side from that one 17" square block and still have stock left over for hub adapters, upright brackets, etc. Depending on what we get donated and when, we may or may not use it, but I just want to make sure we keep track of that stock and how we use it.
The earliest I was expecting the bill to take effect would be late October, so I'd argue that's likely too late. We will want to have sleds built as we're stacking up MDF and to ship out to Comprent
Yep
I did, and they should have hundreds of them so slow shipping can work
_(edited)_ 
That's the plan currently, I'm evaluating if other options are available and making sure we aren't closed out of them.
I want to know how large the boards are so I can make sure we have room in sensible locations in various areas of the car.
Ya could you approximate the increased dimensions so we have upper bounds on size?
Are those the increased dimensions? If not try to approximate those - want to know the bounding dimensions
That was more of a "fight me irl fuckers" than a job invite
"they call awkwardly putting your arm around someone _The Mitchell_, because you sit there like a Mitchell doing _The Mitchell_"
Quite the poet
"There’s a reason for the word ‘stoned.’ You just sit there like a stone on weed.”
   Could one of you provide rough bounding dimensions in physical size of the following boards based on the most advanced rev that we have made actual plans to build:
&gt; Peripheral
&gt; MC^2
&gt; Telem
&gt; Display board
 have you run any rear impact scenarios on the above change?
Probably within the first or second week and over the course of a single shop day. I'll give enough of a heads up before it happens for them to be moved - anticipate the weekend of the 25th at the latest. We don't have anything more critical electrically that needs to be tested before it happens, so probably a 3 days or so heads-up can be expected if it changes.
 Yes it's $100 because we determined we needed to repair 2 strings instead of 1, so it doubled my estimate. I will probably just order it myself for now and we can do official purchasing later.
Ok, just checking. Overall looks good. I was going to ask if someone could tie back the individual components to their system and criticality, but you've pretty much done that already.
 Made some edits, but overall looks good.
 I think you should keep brand names. Nobody is going to care in the worst case, or someone Googles it and becomes interested.
Who wrote that?

SEC served Elon a subpoena for the Tesla tweet
I think the Thai governor or president or whatever emailed him directly. Somehow they got in direct correspondence and became their primary poc. Ya it was made from spare prop raceway tubes with some welded endcaps. Imagine an oil drum with a transparent cap, two oxygen bottles, and some handles on the side.
Honestly there's not enough to the actual design for failure to be a real concern. It's just a tube with a hatch and some oxygen bottles strapped to the side.
Classic
They did all of the documentation after the first sub was on its way
 Basic dimensions, a few drawings, and they went straight to machining
There's virtually no CAD of it actually
Rescuing someone from Hastings, NE is the most worthwhile thing anyone can do
It's very reminiscent of the :runescape_reax: 
Ya they had the NX human model scaled to kid size inside of it
Ya it's called the "Thai Kid Submarine"
I found the design doc for that on our confluence
So the 1-2
I'm only talking in context of the rebuild
Hand drilling this without guiding holes will probably be a nightmare anyway. Tons of stories of ruined mill bits on those forums.

I'm personally ok with ordering a big sheet and going for it. I'm not sure if I could do tests on a small piece and, in the event it works, be 100% certain it will work at scale (or that we won't mess it up). From these larger vids, some of which were at 1/8", I feel confident that it's feasible and up to us to not screw it up.
All of our poly pieces were waterjet, so yes it can handle it. I only hand drilled to get to the connectors using the poly for hole matching.
The stuff looks like solid plastic
We might've jumped a bit early on the G10 delamination hysteria train. I'm finding a ton of videos of people using waterjets (some omax) to cut it
Ya nevermind, everything plastic is within a factor of each other.
Hmm ok
According to the last time we discussed this you had 6/6 as 3x stiffer
I don't know why the conversation drifted to the strength of acrylic or even acrylic as the lead choice. It's hardly any stiffer than poly so we probably won't use it anyway. General strength of any of these materials is incredibly low priority IMO.

 is Nylon 6/6 still the stiffest thing we found that's not a laminate structure?
Is that wrt to me saying vibe breakage isn't a concern?
We really just want stiffness/rigidity, not worried about vibe-induced fracture or breaking or anything
Acrylic is relatively not much stiffer 
We still gotta check the price of 1/8"
Also is that spin off just as stiff, because that's the main driver for getting a different material instead of doubling the poly thickness (and weight and cost).
Got all the same parts there
You can also see it on the rev 1 BoM on the Google drive
Did you change relays too?
Real acid hours
am
He still sent it out at like 9
But fukn lol this guy
At least in a way where acid made the choice
The email he sent out to Tesla was too well composed to be done while on acid
The last one right?
Which string was the problem string?
We don't want horn on there?
Brought the rear wheel forward
Si
Debatable if the bonding is better in theory, but in practice it will be easier to control.
I'm still not sold on avoiding ribs for the _weight_, but I do want to avoid them for the extra work they add, the extra brackets, and in this case the precision required to get it right with ribs. Just wanting to clarify intention there.

Cool, we left the floor of the frame to be a simple rectangle with no height changes, so we'll have a ton of surface area to bond to. I think it will be equally as annoying to reach as with ribs, so not losing much there. Will also bring the cg and general height of the car down more.
Thoughts on bonding the bottom of the frame to the floor of the aerobody? I was initially thinking of having small ribs under the tubes, but now thinking of just bringing the frame to the floor and wet bonding over those tubes with cf. Disadvantage is we can't really take the frame out if we ever wanted to swap in a composite rib chassis (or at least the swap would be messy), but if we want to pick the car up from its bottom that's probably a very secure way of doing it and it means less fuckery with making ribs.
You surrealed that way too hard friend
oh that's interesting
 Can you post those screwed spot weld components you mentioned?
I'm gonna lol if he gives us like a 3 hour heads up on his new tattoo before telling Twitter, but told Tesla about privatizing like an hour after tweeting about 
Emailed the whole company about it
Like full forearm
Lol Elon got a fuckin rocket tattoo on his arm
Yup, we shouldn't have to buy any this year, but we can at least start talking to Michelin or other teams to get a lower rate.
Yep, that's why we can at least try asking for more
Probably next year if we buy them outright. Can certainly open talks for free, but we'll need maybe 3 sets for FSGP if all goes well and I believe we have 4. We do still have Kentucky's set. We could try seating those and if they work maybe buy from them since they actually have hundreds and would probably be forgiving on the price.
Sure now that we've established we _have_ to have something, this seems fine
Hmm, ya I think you're right. So we still need 3 switches at minimum
Using springs is not a bad idea. Probably wouldn't bother with torsional. Would just use hinges and a normal spring.
Reminder that we have shop today. Couple of highlights that we'll be focusing on:
&gt; *Frame:* Mule chassis construction and prep for SR-2 rear bracket welding
&gt; *Aero*: Tool cleaning, battery box kevlar rebonding, preparing staging for the MDF stack-up
&gt; *Suspension*: Uninstall the rear suspension - prepare for cutting and welding this weekend
&gt; *Steering*: Steering wheel prototyping
&gt; *Batteries*: Get BoM ready _tonight_ so we can prepare purchasing process. Begin laying out components in the box mock-up
&gt; *Aux Systems*: Check in with me about aux array - need to finalize wiring diagram (sicheng)
&gt; *Powertrain*: Check out steering's wheel - discuss upgrades and changes
&gt; *Solar*: Check in again about aux array. Need to find a way for us to be able to use that aux array with SR-2 potentially for mock racing
&gt; *Telemetry*: RF testing and start scoping out SMS texting

These are items at the minimum that I'd like for us to focus on. There's more to do, but these are some critical items to either start, do, or discuss. If you're an owner for one of these items and won't be here, please send me a DM.
I'm trying to describe it to sanmesh and can't do it jus:ti:ce
Hey does anyone have the brisket pic of jus:ti:n lee
It's like 2 weeks old, but just seeing it now
you _could_ taper it like the body will be, but we can always just get that milled out.
1" on either side (2" total) on the stackup
% thickness is relative - if it was multiplied by the wrong length, you'll get the wrong absolute width
For the mule chassis
Same % thickness, or same absolute width
Also  what's the order of cuts you're preparing with respect to position on the car?
 6" bending die radius, correct?
Also 
Regarding the draft angle - yes, I can include more of a draft. We're actually running low on solar array space when taking into account SBM's encapsulation on our most recent sunpower batch, so I'm likely going to narrow the bottom/widen the top, and try to create shoulders along the edge anyway. That should provide a lateral draft angle when pulling the part up.

Regarding the wheel space - we'll see what we can do. The options are to make the body wider (explained below, not very bueno), bring the trackwidth in (not great for stability), or bring the front wheels rearward (reduces egress space by bringing steering tube toward the driver). I'll pursue them in reverse order, which is my preference. Making the aerobody more narrow in the front is not fantastic - it can have pretty huge impacts on our drag (if you're curious, the imgur link shows the progression of the first 5 lower hull iterations. From 1-5 the drag was cut in half by extending the length of the body that has a "rising" profile).
It's definitely an improvement concept-wise. Just need to make sure the planform stays the same
enclosure dims are linked a few pictures up the chat
simplest thing we can work with first, maybe upgrade later if we like it
^ This is like a semi-meme pet project btw... most of it was done as a break from main SR-3 work on Saturday. Mostly just keeping everyone up to do date in the event we decide we want to buy/make these. We'll have a review before anything is purchased on the team's dime.

It's been kept simple enough that the odds of working/not working are entirely tied to the barometer and Rx/Tx setup, so it's a pretty minimum viable product. But again, it's an accessory not on our main mission list, so before we dedicate anyone's time assembly/test we'll review it first
Do you guys want to meet up later today to finalize the BoM? If we can't, I can throw whatever has been left out together, including the kevlar/core, tonight, but it'd be good for everyone to know what we're about to purchase. It'd also be a good chance to make sure everyone is aware of the construction process (including the box) and caveats that will come with this design (e.g. we need much smaller fans...)
If we could tack on getting an exhaustive list of necessary tooling for every component in its most complex potential form (i.e. if we have 1.5" swing arms instead of 0.75") I think that'd make for a good use of this week.
Considering the frame will use ~8 and the suspension and other brackets will require several others, too, that seems fine with me.  for awareness
We don't have to keep them either - if it sits pretty snuggly in your hand while reaching for buttons we could just cover it with padding. Thought it might be interesting to try out
 Just curious - how are the little finger bumps in terms of comfort? They were eyeballed, but just curious if they're actually ok here.
You can buy them alone...should be on their website 
We are in 2404 for the meeting 
Good job on the kick off everyone. I know it was a lot of work getting everything together after only 2 weeks of working in-person, but I think we've done a really good job thinking through our options, coming up with solutions, and keeping this design simple, flexible, and practical. It's amazing how much more detailed this was compared to the soft kick off one month ago. At this point I'd argue our  design is even more detailed/thought out than SR-2's was last January. I think we've got a lot to be excited about with this car and I can't wait to see it start materializing. I think we're going to be pretty amazed at how quick and easy this can be.

With the kick off behind us, we have a good baseline to iterate off of. At this point it's critical that _everyone_ understands this design and stays  up to date on the changes. Development  is going to continue to be quick, so now is the best chance to catch up and stay up to date by reading the ppts, watching the recording, and asking tons of questions. Tomorrow I'll send out some updates on refocused efforts to close out our "big three" designs/send them to ASC, as well as starting prefab and fab of our prototypes and battery pack.

Once again, well done everyone - both to the presenters and those of you in the audience thinking critically about each system's choices. If you have any concerns or questions (even "dumb" ones) feel free to shoot a message in the subteam's channel or just shoot me a DM.
Links about to be posted, hang tight
Hey everyone, SR-3 kick-off will be today at 2:30 PM in MRDC 2404 and will likely last until 7. Each subteam will be discussing their current designs, manufacturing plans, and timeline, so it'll be a long meeting. However, I don't expect everyone to be there the entire time. I'll be posting up an agenda of when subteams will be going up to talk. It's perfectly fine for you to dip in for the subteams you're immediately interested in, although I encourage to you to listen in on as many as you can. Each subteam will be open for questions, so this is a good chance to double check their work. While this is not an official design closeout for all systems, we will begin prefab for a lot of our larger systems and begin prototype building for many of the others, so make sure to turn out and give your comments.

If you can't make it in person, I'll be recording everything on our YouTube account and broadcasting over Hangouts. Hope to see you guys there!
From talking around it seems most of us are in consensus on sticking with the 5x7 configuration for the immediate next revision
Good for you
Escaping the mcwastle cooking pit is really hard
It's been a ride
Still working on it
 we goin to Fellini's, Wendy's is broken 
Okily dokily, let's come to a consensus on what to do for SR-3. The test, while confidence-building, certainly doesn't confirm this pack is completely fixed. The removal of the voltage offsets does more for me personally to give hope that it's not a fundamental design issue. The other issue of bus bar contact seen at the race should be covered by the garolite switch and addition of the spacers. Right now the strings are rock solid stiff, even with the poly. To confirm the problem is _gone_ is going to require tons of drive time that only builds confidence instead of offering an absolute gaurantee it's fixed. Even after 320 miles of driving, if the "run-away" of BMS shut-offs happens, then pretty much any confidence we had that we fixed the issue is shattered...so setting that drive time criteria is going to be really arbitrary unless we do some bayesian update black magic probability to calculate a statistical target. This becomes a decent threat to our schedule if we gate SR-3 pack development to meeting that drive time target.

If we started with $3000 of new cells, we could probably pursue other configurations, but with the constraint of re-using what we have I think this 5x7 setup is our best option for a stable pack that we can build and test quickly with enough time left over to start entirely from scratch without bleeding into the summer.

In general, are we confident to proceed with the above design concept along with the improvements we've made? The above concept being to still press the contacts and stand the modules upright using garolite sheets and metal bolts with VHB applied to the intrastring connections.
Should be good now
Thoughts on lid mechanisms? Thinking hinges will be nice for sure, although there's some discussion on that front to be had on whether it should open sideways or longways. I'm a fan of sideways, but while in the car the ribs will stop it from going past 90 degrees, so it'll probably fall back on you while working on it. Length-wise has some issues of easily ripping out the hinges or blocking a ton of stuff when flipped open toward the tail (it'd block the MPPTs and connectors, for example).
^ Images of the pack that should be useful for creating functional maps of wires. This'll be useful to make sure we've allocated enough space for everything or if the box needs to somehow be made larger
An interesting consequence of this is that to move the WS more rearward, we need to shrink the footprint of the precharge battery (see pack image in the album) 
It's the radius where the base of the canopy intersects with the array
at the base of the airfoil
You'd have to increase the thickness of the airfoil to get more space - I just recommend increase the radius at the base
Checking that it won't explode from the tire's pressure compared to ambient. As a side note, I goofed in a good way and put the full 70 psi instead of the delta b/w that and ambient, making it more like ~55 psi, so making this from 3D printed material with solid infill might actually work
Under 70 psi it seems like it'll be reasonable for it to live
The orifices could also be moved to the ABS piece so it's just a simple bore and tap for the adapter
As a side note, the valve stem pusher could be replaced by a smol bolt through the top of the adapter if lathing the extrusion is too difficult.
Ya, same one as used for the soft kick off and the presentations thus far (the one you made)
Go ahead create some slides based on the deliverables using that same template. We'll figure out how to best compile them tomorrow
Basically
  Thoughts?
Another solution might be to go with a non-circular rotation path (like an ellipse) or follow the profile of a hook
Sorry for the late night announcement. A lot of subteams are very close to having their kick-off deliverables met, but could definitely use some final reviews/discussions before being presented. Since we have the 3-day weekend ahead of us, *we'll be moving the kickoff to Monday, 9/3*.

The purpose of the kick-off is to ensure that our baseline designs will both satisfy our performance/reg requirements, but also confirm that we have the flexibility within those designs to improve/iterate with later revs and ensure that we haven't locked ourselves into a risky situation (e.g. before locking down a leading arm suspension, confirm our frame/steering/aerobody allow us to modify/adapt to any foreseeable issues we might have). The key here is for us to make sure we know what we're getting into, make sure we thoroughly understand the risks associated with each system, and confirm that we have contingencies if we're not able to beat those risks. The format of the kick-off will be just like the soft presentation I gave one month ago, except we will also include a timeline for remaining design and manufacturing for the year and each subteam will present their system, requirements, design, and manufacturing process (see the deliverables in the previously linked slides). The kick-off will be recorded and made accessible over hangouts for anybody out of town to tune in and present.

Once again, sorry for the late announcement. For those that'll be here we'll be *having regular shop on Sunday* with a focus on kick-off preparation. I'll also be here all day today (9/1) fleshing out designs and supporting battery testing. Feel free to shoot me any questions you might have.
Let me know if you want me to direct you to CAD. Do you have solidworks ?
Could we throw together a diagram showing the physical routing path tonight?
Ok good, thanks
And an initial idea for how to reach the pack connectors
Included in the imgur link is the battery cradle structure that will attach the pack to the frame
Ya each layer - sorry, so the perimeter of your layers consists of entirely straight lines?
The natural consequence here is that you'll need to take out the 4th string to get to the 5th string...I personally don't think that's a deal-breaker, but it's worth discussing.
One thing to note on the content above - going with the 5x7 configuration does result in the positive and negative sides of the pack being on opposite ends (since the number of strings is odd). I discussed this with  the other day and we explored a couple of options including having a copper plate run underneath the final string to route the positive end back, but a wire over the top seems the easiest.
Since it's so condensed, doing a vehicle-wide wiring diagram with detail to the connector level might be too dense, especially since 90% of the action is in the dashboard. I think a vehicle-wide diagram of harnesses going to a "black box" dashboard that then has its own diagram would make sense.
If we go with the tablesaw method, do we know what our stack-ups would look like?  
 Could you give a quick update on aux systems kickoff readiness? I think the only thing that we're missing is the high voltage, low voltage wiring diagrams - not sure if we've started on those
 Mind giving a quick update on powertrain kickoff readiness?
Any chance we could format that drawing to physically match the wiring layout per board connector? Basically what you've got here, but with each block's connectors/pins defined
shows what I know
ah
hey are you in california by any chance?
/advice 
thanks 
maybe this has something to do with our emails?
it doesn't work anymore
/advice is dead
Was $400/hr their quoted price? If so that is incredibly steep. At our fastest we could do maybe 2 sheets an hour last year, so even with that lower bound that's incredibly expensive (it does validate your estimate, though)
Rotationally lock
If we locked the nut in physically, you would need to get a socket back there. You could just line the nut up to the hole and then rotate the bolt head from the outside. If we did it right the nut wouldn't be able to free spin
From the array to the MPPT's, we could have the box come up to the same height as the battery box floor and have a harness connector for array power. Within, would recommend we give preference to what we're most comfortable with. If we think terminal blocks are good for power distribution and easy to access, we can just go for that.
Separate slides would make more sense
 Did you get any pics of the photon stack-up you CAD'ed yesterday?
One improvement could be to show how the parts would be oriented when doing the operation on them. Like for the holes, indicating that you have the flat back of the control arm's "neck" to give you a stable surface for drilling all of the holes
Just an example of what you could do (I think this level of detail is aight for the kick-off) - here I just covered the entire part with an extrude of its bounding size
Also ya, maybe for those you can just cover up the cuts with an extrude
never
Ok, I'll head over in a few
Anyone else able to come in?
Ok, I'll probably go in around 7'ish after talking with suspension
 ?
Additionally,  have you had a chance to try out any steering effort calculations? Do you want to sit down and go over it some time?
Gotcha, sounds fine - thanks for checking
Dang, ok so, 9/4 and 9/10
  Any updates on if we were able to get a prototype steering wheel in to print?
Good with 6?
How about MRDC
I'm thinking of mixing it up
Be there in 10
Probably biggest thing to discuss is loading philosophy, remaining brake mount, and manufacturing plan. Probably like 1-2 hours tbh, maybe less
Other than 3-4, any time works for me
Honestly, we're going to probably implicitly follow a '"standard" anyway (e.g. "make your bracket look more like these"). Question is if you'd like to compile it so bracket design is incredibly predictable. I think it'd be very worth.
Is it possible for us to continue pack work today maybe some time around 6 or 7 for a couple hours?
  (and anyone else who wants to join) would you guys have time today to talk about remainder of kick off objectives for suspension?
Is that a jojo reference?
why
lol
I can come by for about 30 minutes
would anyone be willing to give a couple of late night battery lads a ride home from shop?
Classic Obama-era weakness
They did wreck us in that robot battle 
Steven in solar is going to CAD up the concepts prior to Saturday so we can choose which ones to try out
Yes, we have two options - go with another four bar linkage with smaller rods attached to the frame (they'll stay there, so no deployment) or put a locking hinge system at the aerobody wall
_Another diplomat said that he could not explain Trump’s Pearl Harbor reference but added that the president relishes historical references and frequently brings up Japan's “samurai past.”_
It's included in the reaction loads from the spindle
I did some initial hand calcs for sizing it. And no we do assume everything takes the bump load with the arms. All the uprights will see, though, are reaction loads at the spindle mount and a steering load that the knuckle mount 
Is it possible to include the connector locations/orientation in the diagram for each board?
  With the frame FEA mostly run (without roll cage), do we have bandwidth to hit the other kickoff target of identifying locations for all major brackets for regs-required systems (ballast, seat, seatbelts, etc.)? Would it help to meet tomorrow to discuss this?

As a side note, the waterjet was online yesterday and we used it to cut battery pack parts, however we encountered an issue with it that I'm hoping Jason can resolve in time for shop, so we might be able to get the suspension brackets cut and prefabbed (weld the brackets themselves) for frame attachment this week.
Sounds good
Something is blocking the waterflow so instead of all going out of the nozzle, it's going through the garnet feed hole
It's not the solenoid, it's the venturi on the probe side
If you can do 2017, that's preferred rn
W:\Team Folders\Mechanical Team\CAD
Added a shortcut in the mechanical CAD folder
When do we think we can get a physically-representative functional 2-D schematic drawn up of the dashboard interior?
Gotcha
Like we don't have a few extra inches?
Did we order to that level of precision with our lengths of tube?
Order another bar? You could just use the one that was going to be straight
How bad is the twisting? If you're applying all of the stub-adapter loads on the bottom through the bolt holes it might be under-estimating the torsion we'll see both from bumping (since the swing arm is offset to the wheel's vertical axis) and turning. In that case it'd be applying the loads right where I have that main outer load path. Instead it'd actually distribute the force across the face of the stub adapter (so that entire face before the webbing)
Ya, if it was just the box we could maybe get around it by making the box provide that angle instead, but with roof-mounted pedals we definitely need the mule chassis to have the correct profile, otherwise the pedals could be like 6" off vertically
The reason I bring that up is that you're seeing no stress on the part that actually holds the caliper. It looks like you could theoretically make those load paths incredibly small and far less thick which doesn't really match what I'd expect.
Ya, the scenario that I think of is one where we've just bottomed out the shock to its max stroke and can't rotate anymore but are still taking the full bump, so in this case it'd be like 800 lbs down at the spring bracket holes and along with the full bump-induced moments.
Oh ok, I can kind of see that now in how it's bending the base bracket. One thing that I thought about when doing the front brake knuckle FEA was about how, when I only constrained the holes, it made the base where those holes were deflect when in reality they have a solid surface (the upright) behind them to transfer those loads. I applied a custom constraint to the base face (the side facing the solid surface) so it couldn't deflect into the solid. Got very different results that made a lot more sense.
Nah, did reply to them, but need a shipping address
Also, shoulder width
Is this with the spring load, braking load, or both?
 I just realized that since we want to have a roof-mounted pedal rack and since the dashboard relies on the frame to provide its viewing angle (wrt to the driver) we may need to make the front of the mule chassis have the same profile as the real frame (from a side-view)
Ok, we could load up the car tomorrow night then. I don't think we'll be needing it for anything between the end of Tuesday and start of Thursday
You mean hooking it to the F350 or loading up the car? We can load up the car the night before at the end of shop.
An estimate to within half a foot is totally fine
     Could you guys approximate your torso height (hip to top of your head) and "leg" length (hip to foot) to within like half a foot in a thread below this message?
I haven't really sat down to do the full FBD if you want to look at it. It really should just be a direct reaction of moment into the stub axle mounting holes
Just to clarify, we cleaned the solenoid and feeding tube. The issue seems to be that the hole for garnet feeding on the nozzle-side is driving water into the tube instead of operating like a Venturi, so we think either that hole is clogged (already tried blowing it out) or maybe some of the orifices in the nozzle are
Modified the dashboard to be more like the box mock-up (easier to make without the drooped snoot). The angle of the main longitudinal frame members does in fact work out where we won't need the droop, so we should be good to just make box, mount it directly, and call it good.
How direct is directly behind? In that picture it's 2" behind the display. And are we using that for each LCD, or one to drive all of them?
Those long aluminum parts actually are the pedals 
We'll do our best, but I'm curious if you see a feasible (easy) alternative that can guarantee water tightness to that IP standard you usually source to.

If we make a box that fits together well enough that we actually need our tolerancing, I think by default it will aptly protect against spraying. We can have holes at the back for drainage since the entire thing slopes down. Otherwise I think building to a tight fit should probably do very well.
 HyTech actually has a pretty simple pedal rack that you could look at too. It even has the whole platform on a rail so you can adjust the position pretty easily.
The other board was the display board (not sure if we'd have one for each)
I think just building a box is fine. I know we think we can't figure it out from a data point over a year ago, but I'm pretty sure we can build a box like this out of plastic sheets.
 wanted to consolidate RF and 4G to a mega
We could avoid the weird droop in the middle of the box by having the dash panel hang back behind the green tube. It'd be further away from the driver (would need to test if that distance is un-usable), but then the enclosure becomes a lot simpler to make.
My arteries would beg to differ
:cookout: :f:
Spread the word
The Chipotle and Zaxby's behind Ikea are both real, although I don't think the Zaxby's has officially opened yet
No, the wood is in our new space though
Sounds good!
Wanna swing by around 3:30?
I'll be hanging around shop doing follow ups with a few teams if anyone wants to join in. In general we're going to keep official shop times dedicated to physical work outside of our office, so off-days/hours like this are good opportunities to do computer and design work.
:triggered: 
  do you guys have time to swing by shop and talk about frame follow-ups from Wednesday? Additionally I'd like to come to a consensus on the wing designs and maybe run some load cases with and without them.
Basic principle to calculate the sideward moment that steering would have to fight in a sidewind is to
&gt; Estimate the location of the center of pressure (it's the area centroid of the top)
&gt; Calculate the distance between the center of pressure and center of gravity
&gt; Idealize the bottom hull as an airfoil - pull from the CAD and import into XFOIL
&gt; Calculate the sideslip angle as *atan(V_side / V_freestream)*
&gt; Run XFOIL with the airfoil at that wind angle
&gt; Extract the CL and CM
&gt; Calculate the dynamic pressure as (0.5*rho*V^2)
&gt; Calculate the lift-induced moment and yaw moment from the airfoil (using CM)
&gt; Combine the two to get total moment induced at the center of pressure

We'll then see what that value looks like and decide if we need to run CFD to get a more detailed answer. This is semi-conservative since the real center of pressure will be closer to the CG.
I'm wearing the solar polo and jeans
It's a little rough, but I'm hoping it should be sufficient to support whatever discussions we end up having
 How compatible with frunk storage would you say your current aux array design is?
Also, you can see how the steering knuckle hardware would fit in - should be double in those spaces if we keep that structure
Bolts are just going through them - they're just there so the top/bottom plates can't deflect downward when we bolt them together
I'm thinking we'll just hold it up, cut to a drawn length that overestimates slightly, and then just eyeball until we're good, then use that one as a baseline for the others
:wewlad:
I have a meeting at 4, can catch you after, though
no, my apartment
FYI it runs, but it's filled with garnet, so we need to do the clean out
I'll need a ride to pick them up. I'd be fine with doing that if we have a waterjet that we can use.
Not sure
login info?
So what do you need for "access"
I see how you play the game
wow what an elaborate ploy, taking our server hostage
shieeeet
oops
_m u l e   c h a s s i s_
Noice, thanks my dude!
 Did you get any pictures of Novum's array stand (or Novum in charging configuration)?
All good ?
Sorry about that - gsuite has extra settings that I had to change. Should be able to view them now
So no big decision making, just general info? I'm trying to set up official ones for kick off prep, so if your meeting isn't trying to be that, then it's good/no worries, otherwise we'll want to make the invite roster more formal
From dynamics
Did we get any good pics of destroyed tires?
Noice!
Could someone find the videos of us nyooming through figure 8 before we started scrutineering?
Could you just DM a quick link to one of the pics if you can find a good one?
Does anyone have pictures of the array damage from the race?
This is just for general awareness, but I measured out what 5083-H116 stock we had lying around shop and got these dimensions:
17x17x6
6x11x3
8.5x4.5x2.5
(two of these ^^)
17.5x8.5x3.25
6.5x5x3.5 (from leftover upright stock, x2)

This is actually enough to make everything except for the uprights with enough left over for multiple tries. The front bottom control arms and rear swingarm, for example, are 3/4" aluminum, so there's enough to make two of each piece for each side from that one 17" square block and still have stock left over for hub adapters, upright brackets, etc. Depending on what we get donated and when, we may or may not use it, but I just want to make sure we keep track of that stock and how we use it.
The earliest I was expecting the bill to take effect would be late October, so I'd argue that's likely too late. We will want to have sleds built as we're stacking up MDF and to ship out to Comprent
Yep
I did, and they should have hundreds of them so slow shipping can work
_(edited)_ 
That's the plan currently, I'm evaluating if other options are available and making sure we aren't closed out of them.
I want to know how large the boards are so I can make sure we have room in sensible locations in various areas of the car.
Ya could you approximate the increased dimensions so we have upper bounds on size?
Are those the increased dimensions? If not try to approximate those - want to know the bounding dimensions
That was more of a "fight me irl fuckers" than a job invite
"they call awkwardly putting your arm around someone _The Mitchell_, because you sit there like a Mitchell doing _The Mitchell_"
Quite the poet
"There’s a reason for the word ‘stoned.’ You just sit there like a stone on weed.”
   Could one of you provide rough bounding dimensions in physical size of the following boards based on the most advanced rev that we have made actual plans to build:
&gt; Peripheral
&gt; MC^2
&gt; Telem
&gt; Display board
 have you run any rear impact scenarios on the above change?
Probably within the first or second week and over the course of a single shop day. I'll give enough of a heads up before it happens for them to be moved - anticipate the weekend of the 25th at the latest. We don't have anything more critical electrically that needs to be tested before it happens, so probably a 3 days or so heads-up can be expected if it changes.
 Yes it's $100 because we determined we needed to repair 2 strings instead of 1, so it doubled my estimate. I will probably just order it myself for now and we can do official purchasing later.
Ok, just checking. Overall looks good. I was going to ask if someone could tie back the individual components to their system and criticality, but you've pretty much done that already.
 Made some edits, but overall looks good.
 I think you should keep brand names. Nobody is going to care in the worst case, or someone Googles it and becomes interested.
Who wrote that?
What is the telemetry master interface board?
When bud does
SEC served Elon a subpoena for the Tesla tweet
I think the Thai governor or president or whatever emailed him directly. Somehow they got in direct correspondence and became their primary poc. Ya it was made from spare prop raceway tubes with some welded endcaps. Imagine an oil drum with a transparent cap, two oxygen bottles, and some handles on the side.
Honestly there's not enough to the actual design for failure to be a real concern. It's just a tube with a hatch and some oxygen bottles strapped to the side.
Classic
They did all of the documentation after the first sub was on its way
 Basic dimensions, a few drawings, and they went straight to machining
There's virtually no CAD of it actually
Rescuing someone from Hastings, NE is the most worthwhile thing anyone can do
It's very reminiscent of the :runescape_reax: 
Ya they had the NX human model scaled to kid size inside of it
Ya it's called the "Thai Kid Submarine"
I found the design doc for that on our confluence
So the 1-2
I'm only talking in context of the rebuild
Hand drilling this without guiding holes will probably be a nightmare anyway. Tons of stories of ruined mill bits on those forums.

I'm personally ok with ordering a big sheet and going for it. I'm not sure if I could do tests on a small piece and, in the event it works, be 100% certain it will work at scale (or that we won't mess it up). From these larger vids, some of which were at 1/8", I feel confident that it's feasible and up to us to not screw it up.
All of our poly pieces were waterjet, so yes it can handle it. I only hand drilled to get to the connectors using the poly for hole matching.
The stuff looks like solid plastic
We might've jumped a bit early on the G10 delamination hysteria train. I'm finding a ton of videos of people using waterjets (some omax) to cut it
Ya nevermind, everything plastic is within a factor of each other.
Hmm ok
According to the last time we discussed this you had 6/6 as 3x stiffer
I don't know why the conversation drifted to the strength of acrylic or even acrylic as the lead choice. It's hardly any stiffer than poly so we probably won't use it anyway. General strength of any of these materials is incredibly low priority IMO.

 is Nylon 6/6 still the stiffest thing we found that's not a laminate structure?
Is that wrt to me saying vibe breakage isn't a concern?
We really just want stiffness/rigidity, not worried about vibe-induced fracture or breaking or anything
Acrylic is relatively not much stiffer 
We still gotta check the price of 1/8"
Also is that spin off just as stiff, because that's the main driver for getting a different material instead of doubling the poly thickness (and weight and cost).
Got all the same parts there
You can also see it on the rev 1 BoM on the Google drive
Did you change relays too?
Real acid hours
am
He still sent it out at like 9
But fukn lol this guy
At least in a way where acid made the choice
The email he sent out to Tesla was too well composed to be done while on acid
The last one right?
Which string was the problem string?
We don't want horn on there?
Brought the rear wheel forward

Debatable if the bonding is better in theory, but in practice it will be easier to control.
I'm still not sold on avoiding ribs for the _weight_, but I do want to avoid them for the extra work they add, the extra brackets, and in this case the precision required to get it right with ribs. Just wanting to clarify intention there.

Cool, we left the floor of the frame to be a simple rectangle with no height changes, so we'll have a ton of surface area to bond to. I think it will be equally as annoying to reach as with ribs, so not losing much there. Will also bring the cg and general height of the car down more.
Thoughts on bonding the bottom of the frame to the floor of the aerobody? I was initially thinking of having small ribs under the tubes, but now thinking of just bringing the frame to the floor and wet bonding over those tubes with cf. Disadvantage is we can't really take the frame out if we ever wanted to swap in a composite rib chassis (or at least the swap would be messy), but if we want to pick the car up from its bottom that's probably a very secure way of doing it and it means less fuckery with making ribs.
You surrealed that way too hard friend
oh that's interesting
 Can you post those screwed spot weld components you mentioned?
I'm gonna lol if he gives us like a 3 hour heads up on his new tattoo before telling Twitter, but told Tesla about privatizing like an hour after tweeting about 
Emailed the whole company about it
Like full forearm
Lol Elon got a fuckin rocket tattoo on his arm
Yup, we shouldn't have to buy any this year, but we can at least start talking to Michelin or other teams to get a lower rate.
Yep, that's why we can at least try asking for more
Probably next year if we buy them outright. Can certainly open talks for free, but we'll need maybe 3 sets for FSGP if all goes well and I believe we have 4. We do still have Kentucky's set. We could try seating those and if they work maybe buy from them since they actually have hundreds and would probably be forgiving on the price.
Sure now that we've established we _have_ to have something, this seems fine
Hmm, ya I think you're right. So we still need 3 switches at minimum
How's it saving anything compared to just removing the precharge contactor?
You wouldn't have feedback, but then it probably wouldn't really be necessary with that much charge time
Ya I was thinking we could just put a resistor in parallel with the motor contactor and apply a 3s delay between the ground and motor contactor. Pretty sure because they're non-latching they wouldn't have a problem unless power to them cut out or something.
Am I reading correctly that you're replacing the precharge contactor with the precharge board?
Ya I know why it hasn't been fully tested yet. I wanted to know how confident are we that we can get this to work in a reasonable timeframe to make Arduino experimentation with a prototype dashboard unnecessary
How certain are we that it will work?
Did we confirm display board works?
Take a look at the CAD that I showed in the kick off video. It's entirely underneath the canopy so that constraint does not exist. Even if it did, depth of dashboard enclosure does not mean the entire dashboard panel has to lean backward - the dash can have walls (if we go with something like what's in the video)
We've entertained the idea of using sms texting to communicate with the driver. Could be that, could be a map of their location on the track, etc.
That would be a height limit
The dashboard depth is negotiable though, so you can potentially have both anyway. No need to necessarily trade screens for enclosure space.
It shouldn't be that much though
Volume limitation 
How does the screen, which is in the panel, drive that directly?
How are you equating 1 less screen to more enclosure space? Flank the dashboard with an enclosure?
I believe  is familiar with some of the people there and could be an in-person follow-up to any exchanges. Unless  cares, go ahead and draft something up and just copy max, arvin, and me at minimum. Would definitely recommend asking:

If we need to go through their training process and when we can do that

What hours that would give us access

What CAM they use just to see if it's the same and if we could reasonably ask for help if needed

Temporary storage of MDF over a day or two if we can't get a truck to haul our stuff is another one, but that's probably left best as a "when it happens" discussion.
Happy birthday !
For reference we're shooting for a 200kg car
Any other thoughts on the idea? Think it's worth it? Easier or harder than a rack and pinion? Ideas for improvements?
The tie rods are going to mount to TBD brackets that bolt onto the upright, so the connection will be:
Upright rod end --- threads into weld nut welded to tube --- tie rod tube --- weld nut on other side --- drag bracket --- steering column --- pillow blocks --- aluminum frame brackets

It goes about 2" down and 1" into it
Ya, or it could be that they're straight and droop or rise when fully extended, but it's ~1 deg and not super noticeable 
Flamethrowers and pedo settlements 
No, this was an estimate.
With a lot of these things we can sub in lighter weight material as replacements once we know it works and if it avoids saturating machines (e.g. making the swingarm adapter welded steel for now, maybe milled aluminum later). Same for the tie rods being carbon. To be completely fair, though, the 1/16" steel tubes are only about 0.3 lbs with weld nuts, so our gains might be very marginal compared to the cost (still down for it). For something like this, steel would be necessary for the steering column (again, talking 0.15 lbs as steel).
As a general cockpit integration note, because the links need to mount below the column since we'll have the knuckles aft of the upright (this way a left steering wheel turn yields a left turn of the front wheels), that opens up more dashboard space at the level of the tube instead of above. Additionally, we could use that dashboard space as the "shroud" that helps isolate the moving links from the driver.
Some more detailed elaboration on the drag-link idea. I think it packages pretty nicely, should be very easy to build, and is potentially $200+ cheaper considering the rack and pinion is being replaced by a small welded steel bracket of &lt;2" waterjet parts each. Additionally the whole assembly is only 1.4 lbs and can route the rods to fit underneath the driver compartment tubes while reaching ideal locations for ackermann geometry - it packages very well. Only issue that I had is that I couldn't make the tie rod "links" align on the same axial axis otherwise they would follow uneven arcs (turning the wheels unevenly), but the misalignment in the rod ends should cover that. They'll also experience ~1 degree of "droop" since it's a sine function, but it poses no significant structural risk and in our range of travel shouldn't soften steering input. This can all be made out of steel with pretty high FoS of &gt;2 even in a 2G turn or a hulk-strength-to-avoid-an-oncoming-truck scenario the scrutineers were worried about. The relation of steering wheel turn to front wheel turn is also fairly linear up to 60 degrees which would likely be the lock-point which can also be adjusted pretty easily by changing the drag length wrt to the knuckle length on the upright. All-in-all, should be really easy to make, holds up structurally pretty well, and weighs hardly anything even as steel. Would like some comments or negative feedback on the concept as a whole, otherwise I think we should make it our baseline and test it on the mule car.
Needs a money sloth variant
In this timeline if you have the ability to _really_ roast someone on Twitter you can manipulate everything they do
9:50
He posted to Twitter before he told you guys I think
 $420/share, eh
It wouldn't necessarily impact steering effort, just the  amount that 1 deg of steering wheel translates to front wheel rotation. I believe the mechanical advantage aspect of it could be handled separately so it could feel the same.
Do we think the full +/- 90 of wheel rotation is vital or intuitive for safe driving? What if it was +/- 60 instead lock to lock? Would people be freaked out by that? Maybe too sensitive?
You can see it under mechanical's folder in the network drive. You might recognize the graph from some general meetings
I had a placeholder for wiring, not a detailed one
We sort of caught it when it arrived because a weight was labelled on the packages, but we were unsure of the accuracy. Plus we were getting the cells for 1.5 cars. We would likely have never caught it prior because we hadn't considered the density of EVA as being a real player. Not much procedurally could've been done to prevent this other than being hyperaware of every gram that could go on the car. I even had a weight tracker going that included bolts and nuts in our weight estimate, but failing to include all of the EVA, the last minute FG add ons, the clear coat paint (I estimate 10 lbs), vinyl, etc added up.
They gave us what we asked for because we definitely didn't check. SBM definitely didn't do anything wrong here.
Either way, that'll fuckin do it. EVA is 926 kg/m^3. At 1/16" that's another 33 or so lbs of weight (22 main array), and I would estimate that's on the conservatively low side.  Seeing an extra 11 lbs on the main array for every 1/32" added.
Ya sure maybe 1/16
No
Would we say the encapsulation is 1/8" thick?
Any locations that just kind of sucked that you doubt they'll ever want to visit again?
Would also be curious to know why you guys think they might be considering re-running it. MPH was pretty average, but did everyone really like the route for its difficulty, the views, the hospitality at the checkpoints and stage stops, etc.? Was the weather beautiful the whole time? Just kind of curious why they'd entertain doing it or something similar so early .
For the SR-3 section do I need to leave comments then or can I just edit it directly?
Are we allowed to make edits?
Agreed on getting bearings to go inside the shock mounts. If it came to it we could mount the shock so it's in the in the "proper" orientation where the bolts pinning it are perpendicular to the arms. It would require a possibly more complex mounting bracket on the frame, but it could be done so it must cantilevers right over the LCA so it barely is bent.
One of the solutions I've been messing with. Effectively adding a welded steel (or milled aluminum if we think we can hack it) adapter. Trouble is making sure the hole for wires remains unobstructed. Mounting the swing-arm at the centerline makes this difficult unless we do something similar to Michigan's setup and have a bolted "roof" that you can take on and off again to access the wires. In this setup the swing-arm mounts above the centerline and 2/6 stub-axle bolts go through the swing arm while 4/6 go through the red adapter. The triangle pieces on the adapter allow for twisting loads from turning to be rigidly transferred downward into the swing arm. Each one should be able to handle the load with ease.

I have it mounted on the bottom so the springs can have a bracket also at the center line (avoids turning the swingarm into a 1st class lever) and so they share hardware. The stub-axle interface plate on the adapter can also be made more complex to grab the calipers which would mount at 6 and 9 to avoid interfering with the shocks. Additionally in an inboard turning load (i.e. I bank to the left, the force comes into the car from the left) the adapter is loaded in compression on the triangles, so that's also good.

In this set up, the assembly consists of waterjetting a 3/4" swingarm about 14" x 7", waterjetting the adapter plate, the two triangles, and the red piece that lays flat on the swingarm (4 steel pieces), welding them together, making a welded spring bracket, and then bolting it all together. Haven't done the FEA, but using very basic def bods and first principles this kind of setup should structurally be ok. Suspension weight of one corner (not including the motor) is about 7 lbs.
We use 6 AWG wire for the phase power lines correct?
Did they have pics too?
Ya I guess that'd be the only alternative. I could see that being reasonable if we didn't let any designs fall into the grey zone - either &lt;3/4" with a ton of webbing complexity or thicker with fewer features so it's easier to work with on the Hass or manual mills
How many did we get? I think there were like 3 in the discussion?
 Did SBM end up sending us those foldable panels
So just to check back up on our machining capabilities, is waterjetting 3/4" aluminum billets out of the question for what we're willing to do? I know we saw ~50% mortality in the 1" thick control arms, but about half of that was setup error that later was fixed, the other half waterjet snafus that we might not be able to control...so somewhere around a 25% chance of messing up a cut.

Would going to 3/4" dramatically improve the odds? Are we just against using the SCC jet? I don't think we saw a ton of blowout issues with &lt;=1", so maybe the only issue is travel error of the jet. Would be good to know if we think we can commit to that method used for the previous control arms in future designs.
As opposed to like, 12 and 9 or something
Think there's any advantage to having uprights mounted at "10 and 2" for example for an independent rear system?
I think that's a little high, but that's still 60% of 50% failures, so 30% of the time. Make two lower control arms and two swingarms, maybe see one of them get messed up because of the waterjet and not us. For the arms I'd call that fine. If we really don't have faith in the waterjet for control arms we'll probably want to talk about that, because it's a really common way to make them and we need to figure that out.

For the uprights, which will be &gt;2" in any direction, sure I agree mostly because it's not the most efficient way of doing it operations-wise now that we have some ability on the Haas.
On anything &gt;=1" sure, but that's not a good "rule" to follow. Majority of the fuck ups on the control arms were our fault.
Yes I can. By "actual" numbers do you still mean with respect to the gimp pack and array number? Probably should just completely leave that out of the picture.

What's on the website is accurate. The discrepancy comes from the change in pack size per Steve's comments, so the data sheet values that pulled from the VDR I submitted in December should be reflective of a 37S instead of 35. The array is also slightly different due to Sunpower giving us wider array cells - possible a different AM standard was used. The basic calculation for full transparency is:

&gt; Pack Energy = (Rated Capacity) x (# in parallel) x (_Nominal_ Voltage) x (# in series) = (3Ahr) x (12) x (3.6V) x (35) = 4536 Wh ~ *4.5 kWh*
&gt; Solar Power = (Irradiance) x (Area) x (Array efficiency ~ Cell efficiency) = (1000 W/m^2) x (4m^2) x (22.5%) = *900W*
Solar power is using the 1.5AM standard for flat plate modules and the C60-J's rated efficiency of 22.5%

Whether we want to go with what matches our race brochure or not is another discussion since it shows the datasheet values, but these are justifiable and accurate numbers.

For SR-3, where do you guys have the current sponsorship doc? I could just add them in wherever you have it.
If anyone with any basic knowledge of the technology we work with sees that we've listed our 4m^2 Silicon array as generating 300W they're going to assume we don't know what we're talking about. Much easier to put the mathematically correct values on paper and then, in person, discuss why qualifying for ASC was a big deal due to our handicaps (if it even comes up). I think that level of "honesty" isn't really necessary. Additionally, we should be using the empty car weight instead of fully laden. It's a lower value and it answers the question "honestly" that people will ask which is "how much does _it_ weigh". Again, don't want them assuming we built a half-ton car, we actually built a 770 lb car that, when the driver is in and ballasted, weighs 950 lbs.
The swing arm is pretty notional in terms of machining btw. There's a not-so-fun problem with making it easy to make (water jet I assume would be the best) but keeping it thin enough (&lt;3/4") to be water-jet-able and also having part of it include the stub-axle bolt pattern of the marand. Right now I've got some bull shit in there, but I was thinking of the idea of having the swing arm be like three parts: the arm itself (the y shaped part), spring bracket, and then a stub-axle adapter that bolts into the arm so they can be made separately on the waterjet. Thots? Pics needed?
CAD: \Team Folders\Strategy\Jackson\Advanced Concepts\Challenger (ASC 2020)\Monohull\Rolling Chassis Assembly
Included here is initial rev bracketing of the attachments btw
Well maybe...thinking back to it I left it hanging back further toward the driver to because the tube drives rack placement...so would that even help? If we have a way to actually have it help then there are pretty much only positives since it also makes egress easier.
Yup, moving it forward is fine
Actually the other concern is the knuckle hitting that tube
Ya that works too. Obviously the big concern there is if the driver might hit it with their knees getting out (could check it in a mule chassis)
My only reason is it puts the bolt at two points of contact in the upright, so it helps when opposing bending. I saw a few teams do that too and in the initial CAD at the kick-off I had a cylindrical bearing kind of deal going on with the top and then a rod end actually hanging out of the upright for the bottom that the control arm bolts to like a clevis. Thought about it more and just wasn't sure about it structurally. It's definitely on the table, I just figured I'd make sure we were compatible with something familiar to us first.
No it just brings them really close to the aerobody
Got code here if you want to see how I did it and check it: \Team Folders\Strategy\Jackson\Advanced Concepts\Challenger (ASC 2020)\Monohull\Steering\Matlab Scripts
A 1.2m wide aerobody
And it's the outer turning radius, so this is Y wheel turn required for the body to remain in a circle of a X radius
As drawn there's not a whole lot of moment arm for turning though
shit ya that was it
hey justin, what was that meme you posted a while ago that made people concerned about your health?
Checked with Jason and that looks good guys. Thanks for coming in and getting this done!
The graphing calculators carry the TI stock tho
 were there any other visualization platforms that let you plot variables against variables or do web-side custom metrics? Grafana is great but I was just curious. Apparently its most common use is for monitoring servers.
Borrowing a power supply for now is a good idea, can definitely ask
FYI most of the people tomorrow said they had to leave by 11, so I put the chances of that happening as described as slim. _Maybe_ the car can get out and charge off the aux array, but we'll see.

What about short term direct purchases?

Also, I'm not worried about it going to 0, more worried that sitting at a low enough voltage just does damage, like if the electrolyte has been squeezed out and hasn't wicked back in, etc.
Did we start putting together a list of power supplies to buy? With the pack at pretty low SoC I'm low-key nervous about going too long without charging it up at least to nominal (should never leave Li-ions resting at top or bottom too long...degrades it hard). Probably fine since it's really at 3.0V, but still.
Not seeing how this is really a solution though
The plan is to decide on which option to go with by the end of the month, the expense will be whatever we buy in garolite to try it out plus minor costs in spacers and metal bolts.

Bolted is fine, the unknowns are minimal, I just think this will fix the issues we saw and let us keep the majority of the work we've already done. By end of the month we'll have done enough work to whether or not to commit to this idea.
Not sure what you're suggesting , the connectors already have a recession that the bus bars fit in. They also have support between each other, so not sure what support you mean.
We're going to _try_, and if it doesn't work change configurations and lay them flat. That latter will take more work and add a lot more unknowns. It'd be ideal if we could just swap plastic, and spacers to the fasteners, swap the tiny nylon bolts with metal for the taps, and then rearrange it to 5 columns of seven modules.
Sounds like garolite is a winner if we can find a good supplier. Grainger sells them and could ship by August 20. We only need effectively two 18"x36" sheets (that's the area anyway). At considering this is at 1/8" instead of the 1/4" for poly it should be cheaper.
And garolite was only 1.5x heavier?
We don't necessarily care about them equally
Your stiffness to weight ratio was? The %'s are fine, I'm talking about that metric specifically not being useful.
The ratio needs to relative to poly btw (stiff/weight of the material is less important). And it's stiffness we care about, but would like to not make thicker.
Garolite, Nylon, HDPE, and Delrin seemed the most promising
From what we have so far, what has the highest stiffness % compared to poly and what has the lowest weight %. I'm kind of assuming the costs won't be insane between any of them, but not sure
Ok I hadn't mentioned garolite so I thought you were asking for polycarb. I don't remember if I chose 1/4" or 1/8", but it shouldn't matter for picking a material.
It'll be the same thickness. Can compare if you get the youngs modulus and divide it by polycarb's. Have we used HDPE before? Seems fine, I imagine it can be waterjet cut
Looks like it's about 17% heavier. How much stiffer is it?
Like I said, nice to have but not necessary
Not huge honestly 
Strongs
Yup strings
Steve liked that you could see through it - I think it's nice too, but not necessary 
Would be a plus
Anyone is welcome to btw
 could you try to find some stiffer alternatives to polycarb? Ideally just as light, but negotiable. Ideally also waterjet machineable, but it can be worked around (at least drillable) and non-conductive
Doomed from the start
Our history is a cursed one
69
The remainder went to the only runner up
It had 3/4 of the vote
One of my roommates was a freshman when the team voted on 49 as the number 
Aight, that's fair. I'd recommend a follow-up email too if you haven't done that already 
How'd those go? Did they mention anything about donation racks of pre-allocated material to give away to universities?
This is a good Christian slack, please refrain from cursing thank you
Friend, you ride the Marta bus*
We need a Marta react
Thank you guys! I'm sure it won't take too much time - really appreciate it!
Aight, so it'll be a 10AM deal on Saturday to move the molds either to the aero tent space or outside and the tools, canopy plug, and MDF box to our space featuring:

Arvin, Eri, Stephanie, Isaac, ~Tiffany~, and Brian
Gotcha, if you can at least help with the big molds you should be good to dip out right after - thanks my dude
So tiffany what's your availability?
Aight, for insurance we'll probably want at least one more:  good for Saturday ~10? I'd ask Mitch too but I know he's out of town
:eyes: 
Jason is asking for everything in eco's space (beyond the wall) to move either out of the space or as far northward as possible. Our largest objects in that space are the molds and rib tooling, so we'll need at least four people to come in and help move them this weekend. The best home for them might just be in the former aero tent space or outside next to the dyno area. The rib tooling and canopy should be able to go against the wall, but bringing it into our area is safer. The MDF box (if it's still there) should probably be disposed of or placed outside.

Given that we had the F350 goof earlier this week, it'll be important that we get this done on time (by Monday). Do I have any volunteers?
 Do we need more welding gas? Jason is about to place an order.
In the couple of times I've done it, I've called first (if it's small) and then followed up with an email and a packet (did that for sunstone and Thermopro). I believe we have some email templates and a "call script", but maybe not a workflow. Definitely would advocate that calling first typically works well when creating it. I believe  may have done something similar with those many small donations we got last semester.
The epoxy at the rack and pinion 
Ya that's correct, the nub on the column is 25% of the knuckle's moment arm about the vertical axis of the wheel.

I'll try to find my math for it and post it later
The steering columns made of cf also broke at the epoxy and had to be replaced with steel
Couple of updates since this was made:
I agree self centering matters little. At the time I thought it would play an influence, but I spoke to Dick and several other teams and the general mantra is just no angles except kingpin so you don't scrub like crazy. I agree no caster is needed in the design. With a leading arm suspension we'll get some caster anyway in the form of gain due to bumps and spring sag.

With a composite chassis it was awkward to mount it, with the tube there's definitely space for it without being too wonky.

Biggest takeaway I got is that I think this is potentially a lot cheaper and far more customizeable than a rack and pinion. You get more direct control over the gear ratio for the steering wheel basically, although with paddles instead of pedals making sure full travel is only a quarter turn of the wheel doesn't matter as much.
How urgent?
Could only replace your last letter though, right? Dibs on the waluigi L
That metric might be on the ASC website

I can't phone in, but if you guys are still going it'd be good to make a list of who to thank and send our race updates to. I understand not wanting to tack on too much to a different meeting, but this might be appropriate to figure out.
You just want to move it closer? I think that's ok as long as the conditions are good enough where you think you can drive it with no risk hitting something.
I want to start getting people on the ball for calling companies now that we have a baseline and a target of getting in immediate material for the big 3 items (frame, suspension, aero) by the end of the month.
Do we want to pair your meeting with a discussion of company contacts in the short term?
Mostly for rear impact protection so we have almost even load paths into the top and bottom longitudinal tubes. The triangle part that sticks out (goes the furthest to the back) is there for the springs on the swingarms to mount to. That whole back area might need to change slightly, though. When moving the frame around I forgot that lower tube and the stub axle are at pretty disimilar heights.

You're asking why not have half of the wing (just the triangle) and then just the parts that attach to the tubes near the rear roll hoop? You need the entire backing of the crush zone to be connected to the chassis, so right now it's just extended as a square the whole way (not sure if I answered your question). Some of Lindsey's earlier models (v5 maybe) had what I think you're asking about.

It can, but I kind of want to do a test to see if that's enough space. That tube is going to the best spot for the steering arms to mount to either the rack or the drag link (depending on what we choose) so it's in a decent place for connecting to the upright at a point convenient for Ackerman steering. Could move it further up though, just might have to make the steering knuckle jut forward and outboard instead of rearward and inside.
I can try to start up conversation again with Sunstone for HyTech's benefit at least. Tbh I'm ok with what we have. How urgently do they need it? Should be able to know if we need better spot welders by end of August when we lock down the pack if they're ok with waiting that long.

One thing Michigan does that I noticed after the race is they have a system set up where they can actual text their driver via SMS and have yes/no buttons on the steering wheel for them to respond.

Thoughts?
They don't interfere, but FYI they're both spinning anyway so they're not moving with respect to each other
Ya I understand, part B extends and becomes all of Part A that doesn't grip the wheel.

Ok, as long as you think we can do that reliably then I'm fine with it. I initially kept them separate since I wasn't sure how well they'd do on a lathe and I wasn't planning for incredibly tight tolerances on the bearings. I agree it'll be more convenient to swap this way, just as long as it's in our ability to build.
Yes I understand - is that something we can easily manufacture though? I figure a lathe might be able to do it, but gripping it is the only thing I'm unsure about.
Needing an arbor press for leverage feels overkill
And the general diameter of the grooves
Also I think we might be overestimating the amount of press fitting required for these bearings based on SR-2's very overdone tolerancing.
You can just have the step in the spindle contact
"pressed" in this case could be far less than in SR-2
For suspension the idea is to build something initially just to test out the geometry, initial assumptions, etc.  Effectively get it really close to what we think would work well for a race and then swap it out if we think we can replace a component to be more intuitive or easier to make. I'm curious what the thoughts are though on manufacturability.
Red is about 1.5", green is closer to 1". I don't think pressing it in is too crazy. Can leave an extra 1/4" or so of threads on the castle nut side that can make sure you have enough thread to really press it together.
Thoughts on the hub adapter though?
